Questionnaires were mailed to all 7,430 state legislators (50 states, 99 chambers) in February 2002, with follow-up letters in March and May of the same year. State legislators were surveyed on the importance of various factors in learning how to do their job, the importance of vari ous sources of information available to them, whether they had authored any bills that became law during their most recent term, whether they specialized in single policy areas, and how much time they spent on legislative duties and tasks. Opinions were sought on the relative influence of party leaders and staff, among others, in determining legislative outcomes, and how much attention party leaders should give to various duties. Additional questions asked whether respondents followed their conscience or the wishes of their constituency when making decisions, the political views of their constituency, and which groups they considered to be their strongest supporters. Information was also collected on opposition candidates, vote percentages, campaign expenditures, previously held public and appointed offices, and future political aspirations. Demographic information includes sex, race, household income, religious preference, political party affiliation, and political philosophy.","1","doi:10.3886/ICPSR20960.v1","icpsr","c(""campaign issues"", ""elections"", ""elective offices"", ""legislative process"", ""political campaigns"", ""political influence"", ""state legislators"", ""state legislatures"", ""state politics"", ""states (USA)"")","NA","NA","2002 State Legislative Survey","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T03:36:39Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR20960.v1","","dataset","2015-04-09T03:36:39Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR20960.v1","36645","RELEASED"

The population of repertoires included only regular subscription series concerts.

We find that the relationship between the distribution of power and international cooperation is complex: a large leading state forms a narrow coalition of intensive contributors, and builds institutions, while a smaller leading state forms a broader coalition that makes shallow contributions, and is more inclined to multilateralism.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/DQ4SCA","slantchev","NULL","2","0","Choosing How to Cooperate: A Repeated Public-Goods Model of International Relations","Branislav Slantchev Dataverse","2011-06-15T00:00:00Z","Branislav Slantchev Dataverse","s3://1902.1/11153","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T07:53:45Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DQ4SCA","55716","RELEASED"

The measurements from these experiments are generally highly integrated and require unique analysis techniques to procure quantitative information. This work describes a methodology to constrain the physics in convergent HED experiments by adapting the methods common to many other fields of physics. As an example, a mechanical model of an imploding shell is constrained by data from a thin-shelled direct-drive exploding-pusher experiment on the OMEGA Laser System using Bayesian inference, resulting in the reconstruction of the shell dynamics and energy transfer during the implosion. The model is tested by analyzing synthetic data from a 1-D hydrodynamics code and is sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a general methodology that can be used to draw conclusions from a wide variety of HED experiments.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","MIT-PSFC","c(""Bayesian Analysis"", ""high pressure"", ""Inertial confinement fusion [ICF]"", ""modelling"", ""plasma"")","2","0","Constraining Physical Models at Gigabar Pressures","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2021-11-18T14:09:41Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","Physics","dataset","2021-11-18T14:09:41Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","283834","RELEASED"

The tutorials can be used either for self-learning or in a laboratory setting. The geographic information system (GIS) and police data were supplied by the Rochester, New York, Police Department. For each mapping software package, there are three PDF tutorial workbooks and one WinZip archive containing sample data and maps. Workbook 1 was designed for GIS users who want to learn how to use a crime-mapping GIS and how to generate maps and data queries. Workbook 2 was created to assist data preparers in processing police data for use in a GIS. This includes address-matching of police incidents to place them on pin maps and aggregating crime counts by areas (like car beats) to produce area or choropleth maps. Workbook 3 was designed for map makers who want to learn how to construct useful crime maps, given police data that have already been address-matched and preprocessed by data preparers.

This study evaluated the accuracy of an integrated proteomic classifier in identifying benign nodules in patients with a pretest probability of cancer (pCA) ≤ 50%. Methods: A prospective, multicenter observational trial of 685 patients with 8- to 30-mm lung nodules was conducted. Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was used to measure the relative abundance of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A. Results were integrated with a clinical risk prediction model to identify likely benign nodules. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value were calculated. Estimates of potential changes in invasive testing had the integrated classifier results been available and acted on were made. Results: A subgroup of 178 patients with a clinician-assessed pCA ≤ 50% had a 16% prevalence of lung cancer. The integrated classifier demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% (CI, 82-100), a specificity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and a negative predictive value of 98% (CI, 92-100) in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules. The classifier performed better than PET, validated lung nodule risk models, and physician cancer probability estimates (P < .001). If the integrated classifier results were used to direct care, 40% fewer procedures would be performed on benign nodules, and 3% of malignant nodules would be misclassified. Conclusions: When used in patients with lung nodules with a pCA ≤ 50%, the integrated classifier accurately identifies benign lung nodules with good performance characteristics. If used in clinical practice, invasive procedures could be reduced by diverting benign nodules to surveillance.

However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win–win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.","NA","doi:10.5683/SP2/63OGB0","borealis_harvested","NULL","NA","NA","Data from: Crop pests and predators exhibit inconsistent responses to surrounding landscape composition","Borealis Harvested Dataverse","2022-02-09T07:03:15Z","Borealis Harvested Dataverse",NA,"NULL","dataset",NA,"https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/63OGB0","NA",NA

Data on crime offense reports and computer aided dispatch (CAD) drug calls and shots fired calls were collected from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Bureau of Police for the years 1990 through 2001. Data on crime offense reports were collected from the Rochester, New York Police Department from January 1991 through December 2001. The Rochester CAD drug calls and shots fired calls were collected from January 1993 through May 2001. A total of 1,643,828 records (769,293 crime offense and 874,535 CAD) were collected from Pittsburgh, while 538,893 records (530,050 crime offense and 8,843 CAD) were collected from Rochester. ArcView 3.3 and GDT Dynamap 2000 Street centerline maps were used to address match the data, with some of the Pittsburgh data being cleaned to fix obvious errors and increase address match percentages. A SAS program was used to eliminate duplicate CAD calls based on time and location of the calls. For the 1990 through 1999 Pittsburgh crime offense data, the address match rate was 91 percent. The match rate for the 2000 through 2001 Pittsburgh crime offense data was 72 percent. The Pittsburgh CAD data address match rate for 1990 through 1999 was 85 percent, while for 2000 through 2001 the match rate was 100 percent because the new CAD system supplied incident coordinates. The address match rates for the Rochester crime offenses data was 96 percent, and 95 percent for the CAD data. Spatial overlay in ArcView was used to add geographic area identifiers for each data point: precinct, car beat, car beat plus, and 1990 Census tract. The crimes included for both Pittsburgh and Rochester were aggravated assault, arson, burglary, criminal mischief, misconduct, family violence, gambling, larceny, liquor law violations, motor vehicle theft, murder/manslaughter, prostitution, public drunkenness, rape, robbery, simple assaults, trespassing, vandalism, weapons, CAD drugs, and CAD shots fired.","1","doi:10.3886/ICPSR04545.v1","icpsr","c(""aggravated assault"", ""arson"", ""assault"", ""burglary"", ""crime mapping"", ""crime patterns"", ""crime prediction"", ""driving under the influence"", ""drug law offenses"", ""fraud"", ""geographic information systems"", ""homicide"", ""rape"", ""robbery"", ""trend analysis"")","NA","NA","Development of Crime Forecasting and Mapping Systems for Use by Police in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Rochester, New York, 1990-2001","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T04:38:27Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR04545.v1","","dataset","2015-04-09T04:38:27Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04545.v1","42269","RELEASED"

Experimental yields on the OMEGA Laser System, however, have shown much less sensitivity to this initial target offset. This paper presents simulations of offset ICF implosions improved by including a physics model of cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a mechanism of laser energy scattering from one beam to another. Room-temperature OMEGA implosion experiments with prescribed target offsets are simulated with and without CBET, illustrating that CBET mitigates the ℓ = 1 implosion asymmetry from target offset. Comparison of simulations to multiple complementary experimental observables indicates the addition of CBET physics in offset simulations is necessary to match experimental results.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","MIT-PSFC","c(""capsule offsets"", ""cross beam energy transfer"", ""direct drive"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""radiation hydrodynamics simulation"")","2","0","Effect of cross-beam energy transfer on target-offset asymmetry in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2021-11-17T14:11:34Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","Physics","dataset","2021-11-17T14:11:34Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","283784","RELEASED"

Background: Stretching is commonly used in physical therapy as a rehabilitation tool to improve range of motion and motor function. However, is stretching an efficient method to improve gait, and if so, for which patient category? Methods: A systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials with meta-analysis was conducted using relevant databases. Every patient category and every type of stretching programs were included without multicomponent programs. Data were meta-analysed where possible. Estimates of effect sizes (reported as standard mean difference (SMD)) with their respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were reported for each outcome. The PEDro scale was used for the quality assessment. Results: Twelve studies were included in the analysis. Stretching improved gait performance as assessed by walking speed and stride length only in a study with a frail elderly population, with small effect sizes (both SMD= 0.49; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.96; PEDro score: 3/10). The total distance and the continuous walking distance of the six-minute walking test were also improved only in a study in an elderly population who had symptomatic peripheral artery disease, with large effect sizes (SMD= 1.56; 95% CI: 0.66, 2.45 and SMD= 3.05; 95% CI: 1.86, 4.23, respectively; PEDro score: 5/10). The results were conflicting in healthy older adults or no benefit was found for most of the performance, spatiotemporal, kinetic and angular related variables. Only one study (PEDro score: 6/10) showed improvements in stance phase duration (SMD=-1.92; 95% CI: -3.04, -0.81), swing phase duration (SMD=1.92; 95 CI: 0.81, 3.04), double support phase duration (SMD= -1.69; 95% CI: -2.76, -0.62) and step length (SMD=1.37; 95% CI: 0.36, 2.38) with large effect sizes. Conclusions: There is no strong evidence supporting the beneficial effect of using stretching to improve gait.

Participants remained separated in their private testing rooms and were told they were about to discuss a hypothetical event with their romantic partner. One person was randomly assigned to be the discloser of good news: Experimenters incorporated the participants' answers from the initial questionnaire and indicated to disclosers they had been hypothetically hired for their “dream” job or accepted into their “dream” graduate program. The other members of the romantic dyads—the responders—were informed that their partners received this good news. After role assignment, we implemented a manipulation of the conversation context. In the noncorrespondent condition, couples were told to imagine having to live apart from their partners and endure a long- distance relationship. The news was noncorrespondent for disclosers because the pursuit of their dream job (i.e., self-directed goal) conflicted with their relationship-directed goal. The news was also non- correspondent for responders who would have to endure a long-distance relationship so that their partners could pursue their dream jobs. In the correspondent condition, couples were told to imagine they could live together, with the news being positive for disclosers, responders, and the relationship. Participants were explicitly asked to discuss how this news would make each of them feel and how the news would impact their relationship in the short-term and the long-term. After receiving manipulation instructions, disclosers and responders remained in their private testing rooms for an anticipatory period during which they were given three minutes to “gather their thoughts” to prepare for the conversation. A set of double doors that separated the two private testing rooms was opened to create one, large dyad room when the preparation period ended. Couples then engaged in a conversation for 5-min. After the conversation, participants returned to their private testing rooms for a 3 min recovery period and completed questionnaires. Then, couples reversed roles, such that the discloser in the first conversation was now in the responder role and vice versa. We followed up with couples 3 months after the laboratory session.","0","doi:10.15139/S3/MQA2KN","odum","Social Sciences","NA","NA","Examining the Physiological, Cognitive, and Physiological Effects of Capitalizing on Good News that is Relationship Threatening, 2016","ODUM Harvested  Dataverse","2020-01-22T07:00:57Z","ODUM Harvested  Dataverse","s3://10.15139/S3/MQA2KN","list()","dataset","2020-02-12T16:35:32Z","https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/MQA2KN","181854","RELEASED"

Scaled laboratory experiments studying the interaction of an inflowing solar wind analog with a strong, external magnetic field are a promising new way to study magnetospheric physics and to complement existing models, although reaching regimes favorable for magnetized shock formation is experimentally challenging. This paper presents experimental evidence of the formation of a magnetized bow shock in the interaction of a supersonic, super-Alfvenic plasma with a strongly magnetized obstacle at the OMEGA laser facility. The solar wind analog is generated by the collision and subsequent expansion of two counter- propagating, laser-driven plasma plumes. The magnetized obstacle is a thin wire, driven with strong electrical currents. Hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code predict that the colliding plasma source meets the criteria for bow shock formation. Spatially resolved, optical Thomson scat- tering measures the electron number density, and optical emission lines provide a measurement of the plasma temperature, from which we infer the presence of a fast magnetosonic shock far upstream of the obstacle. Proton images provide a measure of large-scale features in the magnetic field topology, and reconstructed path-integrated magnetic field maps from these images suggest the formation of a bow shock upstream of the wire and as a transient magnetopause. We compare features in the reconstructed fields to two-dimensional MHD simulations of the system.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","MIT-PSFC","c(""bow shock"", ""FLASH"", ""hydrodynamic simulation"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetospheric physics"")","2","0","Experimental observations of detached bow shock formation in the interaction of a laser-produced plasma with a magnetized obstacle","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2023-01-01T14:05:53Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","Physics","dataset","2023-01-01T14:05:53Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","337641","RELEASED"

This paper analyses a new panel dataset of local public goods provision in a single North Indian district with observations at the village-decade level going back to 1905 and detailed information on colonial land tenure institutions and demographics. The presence of large colonial landowners is positively associated with rural public goods provision when the landlord was resident in the early 20th century, and has a null effect when the landlord was an absentee. Villages inhabited or owned by upper castes had an advantage in the colonial and immediate post-independence eras, but not afterwards. The results suggest that within unequal societies, economic and status inequalities can have positive effects on public goods provision when they link elites to extra-local decisionmakers.","7","doi:10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","cps","NULL","1","0","Historical Inequality at the Grassroots:  Local Public Goods in an Indian District, 1905-2011","Comparative Political Studies Dataverse","2023-01-09T13:40:44Z","Comparative Political Studies Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","Social Sciences","dataset","2023-01-09T13:40:44Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","336570","RELEASED"

There were three components to the intervention: (1) an educational program delivered through home visits (weekly during the first year and every other week during the second and third years of life), (2) a daily center-based program beginning at 12 months corrected for duration of gestation, and (3) parent support groups coinciding with the start of the center-based program. Previously, the subjects were assessed at baseline up to age 3 (Phase I), age 5 (Phase II), and age 8 (Phase III). Phase IV assessed them at age 18.

A technique to quantify the hot electron preheat of the dense DT fuel and connect it to the degradation in areal density is described in detail. Hot electrons are measured primarily from the hard x-rays they emit as they slow down in the target. The DT preheat is inferred from a comparison of the hard x-ray signals between a DT-layered implosion and its mass equivalent ablator only implosion. The preheat energy spatial distribution within the imploding shell is inferred from experiments using high Z payloads of varying thicknesses. It is found that the electrons deposit their energy uniformly throughout the shell material. For typical direct-drive OMEGA implosions driven with an overlapped intensity of ∼9·10^14 W/cm2, approximately ∼0.02%–0.03% of the laser energy is converted into preheat of the stagnated fuel which corresponds to areal density degradations of 10%–20%. The degradations in areal density explain some of the observed discrepancies between the simulated and measured areal densities.","0","doi:10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive implosion"", ""hot electrons"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""OMEGA Laser Facility"", ""preheat"")","1","0","Inferences of hot electron preheat and its spatial distribution in OMEGA direct drive implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2023-02-28T18:46:26Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","Physics","dataset","2023-02-28T18:46:26Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","341329","RELEASED"

The mother's care-giving environment and the child's health and development were evaluated by the Bavolek adult-adolescent parenting interview score, the Caldwell home observation scale, the Bayley mental development index, the Achenbach child behavioral problems inventory, and other indices. Levels of social support were evaluated by the amount of support expected to be received from a boyfriend or husband and the mother's mother. Assessments of maternal psychological resources included the Pearlin mastery scale, the Shipley IQ score, and the Bandura self-efficacy score. Personal life-course development was assessed by the respondents' educational and occupational achievements, and the numbers of subsequent pregnancies and children. Variables measuring the effect of the program on the cost of health care include number of hospital emergency room visits, number of hospitalizations, total length of stay, number of well-child and ill-child doctor visits, and use of community social services. Other variables provide information on age at birth, pre-pregnancy weight, birth weight and gender, race, employment status, income, housing density, and education.","1","doi:10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","icpsr","c(""health behavior"", ""health care services"", ""prenatal care"", ""visiting nurses"")","NA","NA","Memphis New Mothers Study, 1990-1994","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T03:14:26Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","","dataset","2015-04-09T03:14:26Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","34623","RELEASED"

In this paper, the effects of asymmetric compression of cryogenic deuterium tritium laser-direct-drive implosions are examined using a suite of nuclear and x-ray diagnostics on the OMEGA laser. The neutron-averaged hot-spot velocity (~uhs) and apparent ion temperature (Ti) asymmetry are determined from neutron time-of-flight measurements of the primary deuterium tritium fusion neutron energy spectrum, while the areal density (rhoR) of the compressed fuel surrounding the hot spot is inferred from measurements of the scattered neutron energy spectrum. The low-mode perturbations of the hot-spot shape are characterized from x-ray self-emission images recorded along three quasi-orthogonal lines of sight. Implosions with significant mode-1 laser drive asymmetries show large hot-spot velocities (>100 km/s) in a direction consistent with the hot-spot elongation observed in x-ray images, measured Ti asymmetry, and rhoR asymmetry. Laser drive corrections have been applied through shifting the initial target location in order to mitigate the observed asymmetry. With the asymmetry corrected, a more-symmetric hot spot is observed with reduced ~uhs, Ti asymmetry, rhoR asymmetry, and a 30% increase in the fusion yield.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive implosion"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""low-mode asymmetry"", ""neutron spectrometry"", ""OMEGA Laser Facility"")","2","0","Mitigation of mode-one asymmetry in laser-direct-drive inertial confinement fusion implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-04-01T13:27:05Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","Physics","dataset","2022-04-01T13:27:05Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","324071","RELEASED"

Performances of police agencies organized in different ways were compared as they delivered services to different sets of comparable neighborhoods. For Part 1, Citizen Debriefing Data, data were drawn from telephone interviews conducted with citizens who were involved in police-citizen encounters or who requested police services during the observed shifts. The file contains data on the citizens involved in observed encounters, their satisfaction with the delivered services, and neighborhood characteristics. This file includes variables such as the type of incident, estimated property loss, police response time, type of action taken by police, citizen satisfaction with the handling of the problem by police, reasons for dissatisfaction, the emotional state of the citizen during the encounter, whom the officers referred the citizen to for help, the citizen's prior contacts with police, and the citizen's education, age, sex, and total family income. Part 2, General Shift Information, contains data describing the shift (i.e., the eight-hour tour of duty to which the officers were assigned), the officers, and the events occurring during an observed shift. This file includes such variables as the total number of encounters, a breakdown of dispatched runs by type, the number of contacts with other officers, the number of contacts with non-police support units, officer discretion in taking legal action, and officer attitudes on patrol styles and activities. Part 3, Police Encounters Data, describes police encounters observed by the research team during selected shifts. It consists of information describing the officers' role in encounters with citizens observed during a shift and their demeanor toward the citizens involved. The file includes variables such as the type of encounter, how the encounter began, whether the citizens involved possessed a weapon, the encounter location, what other agencies were present during the encounter and when they arrived, police actions during the encounter, the role of citizens involved in the encounter, the demeanor of the officer toward the citizens during the encounter, actions taken by the citizens, which services were requested by the citizens, and how the observer affected the encounter. Part 4, Victimization Survey Data, examined citizen attitudes about the police and crime in their neighborhoods. The data were obtained through telephone interviews conducted by trained interviewers. These interviews followed a standard questionnaire designed by the project leaders. Variables include perceived risk of victimization, evaluations of the delivery of police services, household victimization occurring in the previous year, actions taken by citizens in response to crime, and demographic characteristics of the neighborhood.","4","doi:10.3886/ICPSR08605.v3","icpsr","c(""crime"", ""police activity"", ""police protection"", ""United States"", ""Missouri"", ""Missouri-St. Louis"", ""victimization"")","NA","NA","Police Services Study, Phase II, 1977:  Rochester, St. Louis, and St. Petersburg","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T04:10:21Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR08605.v3","","dataset","2015-04-09T04:10:21Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR08605.v3","39710","RELEASED"

We propose that this stabil- ity is founded upon peaceful power sharing between the rebel regime leader and military elites. Amid long and intense fighting, rebel leaders must delegate control to top military commanders because doing so helps them to win battles. After seizing power, power-sharing deals between former combatants are highly credible due to their history of interactions, which mitigates the guardianship dilemma. Elsewhere, a persistent internal security dilemma often undermines power-sharing deals. Using originally collected data on African regimes from 1960–2017, we establish that rebel regimes break down seldomly compared to other authoritarian regimes, and experience fewer coups. Regarding the mechanism, rebel regimes more frequently share power with military elites by appointing a Minister of Defense. These Ministers are typically high-ranking members of the rebellion, which reflects the regime’s replacement of the state military with their own.","6","doi:10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","the_review","NULL","1","0","Power Sharing and Authoritarian Stability: How Rebel Regimes Solve the Guardianship Dilemma","American Political Science Review Dataverse","2022-04-13T14:00:47Z","American Political Science Review Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","Social Sciences","dataset","2022-04-13T14:00:47Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","313703","RELEASED"

Thus, these kinds of ""single-shot"" causal inference methods are inappropriate for dynamic processes like campaigns. I resolve this dilemma by adapting methods from biostatistics, thereby presenting a holistic framework for dynamic causal inference. I then use this method to estimate the effectiveness of an inherently dynamic process: a candidate's decision to ""go negative."" Drawing on U.S. statewide elections (2000-2006), I find, in contrast to the previous literature and alternative methods, that negative advertising is an effective strategy for non-incumbents.

This paper combines two approaches to sensitivity analysis to provide researchers with a tool to investigate how specific violations of no omitted variables alter their estimates. This approach can help researchers determine which narratives imply weaker results and which actually strengthen their claims.

Monte Carlo results demonstrate that for many applied research situations, this distribution is indeed highly peaked. The simulation further demonstrates that the proposed test has greater power than the Vuong test under these conditions. The substantive application addresses the effect of domestic political institutions on foreign policy decision making.

Although a single data generation process can produce all of these three data types, the statistical literature is not very helpful in providing methods to estimate parameters of the same process from each. In fact, only a single theoretical process exists for which known statistical methods can estimate the same parameters—and it is generally used only for count and duration data. The result is that seemingly trivial decisions about which level of data to use can have important consequences for substantive interpretations. We describe the theoretical event process for which results exist, based on time independence. We also derive a set of models for a time-dependent process and compare their predictions to those of a commonly used model. Any hope of understanding and avoiding the more serious problems of aggregation bias in events data is contingent on first deriving a much wider arsenal of statistical models and theoretical processes that are not constrained by the particular forms of data that happen to be available.

In this article we develop and test a novel theory of policy choice and candidate selection that defies this conventional wisdom: it is the Right that capitalizes on descriptive representation in high poverty areas. The Right is only competitive in poor regions when it matches the Left’s pro-poor policies. To credibly shift its position, it nominates candidates that are descriptively closer to the poor. Using a regression discontinuity design in Brazilian municipal elections, we show that Right-wing mayors spend less on the poor than Left-wing mayors only in low-poverty municipalities. In high-poverty municipalities, not only does the Right match the Left’s policies, it also does so while nominating less-educated candidates.","20","doi:10.7910/DVN/DQTIR4","ajps","c(""Descriptive representation"", ""Public policy"")","1","1","Replication Data for: Can Descriptive Representation Help The Right Win Votes From The Poor?

Official investment directives and state visits link investments to state policies; Taiwan recognition and Dalai Lama meetings anchor our political interpretations; UN General Assembly voting and temporary UN Security Council membership suggest that this intervention may be systematic.

To get over its notorious conservatism, we advocate using the Bonferroni selection rule as a procedure that controls the per family error rate (PFER). The present paper reports the first study of stability properties of the Bonferroni and Benjamini–Hochberg procedures. The Bonferroni procedure shows a superior stability in terms of the variance of both the number of true discoveries and the total number of discoveries, a property that is especially important in the presence of correlations between individual p-values. Its stability and the ability to provide strong control of the PFER make the Bonferroni procedure an attractive choice in microarray studies.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/PFKQFJ","AOAS","c(""Multiple testing"", ""stability"", ""Bonferroni method"", ""microarray data"")","1","0","Replication data for: Control of the Mean Number of False Discoveries, Bonferroni, and Stability of Multiple Testing","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","2007-11-28T00:00:00Z","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","s3://1902.1/10651","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T09:07:14Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PFKQFJ","66701","RELEASED"

Self-enforcing democracy requires that political parties refrain from exploiting legal opportunities to tilt electoral rules. Using a formal model, we argue that informal norms of mutual forbearance and formal constitutional rules are fundamentally intertwined via a logic of deterrence. By circumscribing how far each party can legally bend the rules, legal bounds create reversion points if mutual forbearance collapses. If legal bounds are symmetric between parties, they deter electoral tilting by making credible each party's threat to punish transgressions by the other. If legal bounds become sufficiently asymmetric, however, the foundations for forbearance crumble. Asymmetries emerge when some groups (a) are more vulnerable than others to legally permissible electoral distortions and (b) favored and disfavored groups sort heavily into parties.

The first hypothesis qualifies Europeans’ impulse for representative institutions by positing the importance of a metropole with a representative tradition. Analyzing new data on colonial legislatures in 144 colonies between the 17th and 20th centuries shows that only British settler colonies—emanating from a metropole with representative institutions—systematically exhibited early elected legislative representation. The second hypothesis highlights a core democratic contradiction even in colonies that established early representative institutions. Extending class-based democratization theories predicts perverse institutional evolution—resisted enfranchisement and contestation backsliding—because sizable European settler minorities usually composed an entrenched landed class, rejecting the heralded Dahlian path from competitive oligarchy to full democracy. Evidence on voting restrictions and on legislature disbandment from Africa, the British Caribbean, and the U.S. South supports these implications.","5","doi:10.7910/DVN/LU8IDT","world-politics","c(""Colonialism"", ""Democracy"", ""European settlers"", ""Institutions"")","1","0","Replication Data for: Democratic Contradictions in European Settler Colonies","World Politics Dataverse","2019-05-15T12:31:43Z","World Politics Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/LU8IDT","Social Sciences","dataset","2019-05-15T12:31:43Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LU8IDT","150371","RELEASED"

These substructures include stochastic proportionality of expression signals in a large percentage of all gene pairs, negative correlations hidden in ordered gene triples, and a long sequence of weakly dependent random variables associated with ordered pairs of genes. The reported striking regularities are of general biological interest and they also have far-reaching implications for theory and practice of statistical methods of microarray data analysis. We illustrate the latter point with a method for testing differential expression of non-overlapping gene pairs. While designed for testing a different null hypothesis, this method provides an order of magnitude more accurate control of type 1 error rate compared to conventional methods of individual gene expre ssion profiling. In addition, this method is robust to the technical noise. Quantitative inference of the correlation structure has the potential to extend the analysis of microarray data far beyond currently practiced methods.","6","doi:10.7910/DVN/Z6UE8D","AOAS","c(""correlation structure"", ""gene expression"", ""microarrays"")","1","0","Replication data for: Diverse Correlation Structures in Microarray Gene Expression Data","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","2008-01-04T00:00:00Z","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","s3://1902.1/10645","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T09:07:17Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Z6UE8D","66709","RELEASED"

To assess this idea, we examine the consequences of the implementation of random electoral quotas for women on the representation of caste groups in Delhi. Constituencies reserved for women are less likely than unreserved constituencies to elect members of groups where the status of women is low. In practice, this means they are less likely to elect members of several traditionally underprivileged groups (especially OBC castes) and more likely to elect candidates from the Hindu upper castes. The results highlight the difficulties of balancing descriptive representation on multiple, cross-cutting dimensions, and the possible unintended consequences of the type of single-dimension quotas currently proposed for inclusion in the Indian constitution.","8","doi:10.7910/DVN/0QOVCH","ajps","c(""Gender quotas"", ""Intersectionality"")","1","1","Replication Data for: Do Gender Quotas Hurt Less Privileged Groups?

Focusing largely on polarization as a (negative) indicator of party indifference, the existing empirical work has found mixed results. We re-examine this question, recognizing that polarization influences voters through perceptions of both alienation and indifference; we argue that the effect of polarization depends on the position of the voter relative to the party options. We introduce a new relative measure of polarization and test its effect on turnout in the two-rounds of the French presidential elections. We find that where a voter stands relative to the spread of party options is a significant predictor of turnout. If parties are either far away from the voter or are indistinguishable from each other, there is little incentive to turn out. On the other hand, party polarization leads to higher participation when the voter is close to one party and far from another.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","harvard","Turnout, Polarization, Alienation, Indifference, Runoff Elections, France","1","0","Replication Data for: Does Party Polarization Mobilize or De-Mobilize Voters?","Harvard Dataverse","2021-01-12T22:22:10Z","Harvard Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-01-12T22:22:10Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","228015","RELEASED"

This article argues that specific economic activities—those that undermine a producer’s ability to exit the formal economy—cause governments to make taxation decisions that, despite the costliness of fighting, increase the likelihood of civil war. An inability for producers to exit the formal economy also undermines regional autonomy deals by encouraging governments to grab short-term rents despite the risk of triggering civil war. After deriving this “redistributive grievance” mechanism by analyzing an infinite-horizon bargaining model with endogenous labor supply and economic production, I address a specific empirical source of such redistributive grievances: oil-rich regions fight separatist civil wars relatively frequently. Capital-intense, geographically concentrated, and immobile oil production corresponds with conditions in the formal model that predict redistributive grievances and war. Moreover, I argue that applying the redistributive grievances mechanism to understanding the oil-separatism relationship also highlights shortcomings of alternative “greed”-based explanations.","8","doi:10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","harvard","Civil war, resource curse","1","0","Replication Data for: Economic Grievances and Civil War: An Application to the Resource Curse","Harvard Dataverse","2019-09-18T15:58:49Z","Harvard Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","Social Sciences","dataset","2019-09-18T15:58:49Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","174595","RELEASED"

In doing so, we provide evidence that both outcomes—the existence of constraining institutions and growth—are driven by initial conditions that fostered technical know-how embodied in urban-dwelling artisans who, in turn, were able to force institutional limits on rulers’ actions.

Abstract: Internal migration is thought to have substantial benefits for migrants and for the development of migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas. In order to facilitate such migration, central governments may need to use fiscal transfers to ensure services to migrants, address infrastructure shortfalls, and ameliorate labor market displacement of natives. In fact, an extensive, mostly normative ``fiscal federalism'' literature has argued that central governments ought to use transfers to reduce interjurisdictional externalities such as those due to population displacements. We extend this literature empirically by examining the degree to which exogenous, long-term migration prompts the redirection of central fiscal resources in India. Following the literature on distributive politics, we argue that transfers in decentralized systems addressing the costs of population movements are influenced by partisan politics. Using monsoon shocks to migration, we show that increases in migration are met with greater central transfers but that these flows are at least 50% greater if the state-level executive is in the Prime Minister's political party. Consistent with the theory, the influence of politics is greatest on parts of the budget subject to greater executive control. This politicization may explain why Indian states maintain barriers to internal migration despite the development costs of doing so.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/TCGEDH","rbandbl","NULL","1","0","Replication Data for: Fiscal Federalism at Work?

I show that representation in the ruling party conditioned the likelihood of a violent statehood movement. Pro-statehood groups that were politically advantaged over the interests opposed to them were peacefully accommodated. Statehood movements similar in political importance to their opponents used violence. Very politically-disadvantaged groups refrained from mobilization, anticipating repression.

We hypothesize that both are correct—that compactness is complex and multidimensional, but a common understanding exists across people.

This paper instead theorizes explicitly about the conditions under which politicians are prone to manipulate their courts. By positing that courts can partly endogenously shape leaders’ fate at the hands of legislative opponents, we argue that greater political insecurity leads presidents to gut judicial independence, not shore it up. Drawing on a novel dataset of judicial crises across eighteen Latin American countries following the third wave of democratization, we show that variation in judicial crises is systematically correlated with the president’s risk of non-electoral instability as captured by the history of past presidential crises, presidential power, and anti-governmental protests. To identify whether the effects of protest on judicial manipulation are causal, we use an instrumental variable approach based on international commodity prices weighted for each country. By treating institutional crises as inter-connected strategic decisions, this paper cuts against the tendency in the literature to treat these phenomena along parallel tracks; with one literature on presidential crises and another on judicial politics. Rather, constitutional hardball -- in all of its manifestations -- should be studied under a unified theoretical framework.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/NDAAFU","jlc","NULL","1","0","Replication Data for: Insecure Institutions: A Survivalist Theory of Judicial Manipulation in Latin America","Journal of Law and Courts Dataverse","2021-12-07T13:47:52Z","Journal of Law and Courts Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/NDAAFU","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-12-07T13:47:52Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NDAAFU","253040","RELEASED"

However, a prior question that must have occurred to the reader is whether it is normatively desirable for the IMF to exercise influence, and I turn to this question before proceeding with my argument. Critics of unbridled capital markets and the ""Washington Consensus"" that supports them worry that international institutions and global capital flows may so constrain economic policies during the transition that weak democratic institutions are swept away by popular discontent. Furthermore, they argue, the IMF's neoliberal economic prescriptions of tight monetary and fiscal policies, deregulating the economy, and lowering the barriers to the ""creative destruction"" wreaked by markets—stabilization, liberalization, and privatization—represent a naïve application of standardized recipes to a much more complex reality. In the felicitous Russian aphorism, it is easy to turn an aquarium into fish soup, but only God can reconstitute the aquarium. To the contrary, I argue that the basic thrust of the policies urged by the international financial institutions was, in fact, correct. At this point, I want to distinguish carefully between the basic strategy of transition and the specific tactical choices that were made in particular countries. By tactical choices I mean operational decisions on which economic theory does not yet provide straightforward guidance, such as the best ways of targeting exchange rates, the ideal method of privatization, and the optimal sequence of structural reforms. The Fund supported programs in countries that chose a wide range of approaches to these issues, but in some cases IMF staff promoted specific policies that turned out very poorly. We have learned things about economic transitions over the last ten years that would have made it possible to make better choices, had we known them earlier. On the other hand, the key IMF strategy for reform was clear: Accelerate the full spectrum of m arket reforms as much as possible, and lead with rapid macroeconomic stabilization and liberalization. This appeared to be a rather risky strategy from the vantage point of 1990. After a decade of experience, however, it is clear that this was the strategy best suited to promoting economic growth and consolidating democracy in post-Communist countries, because inflation has such disastrous consequences during the transition.","16","doi:10.7910/DVN/LAXKLR","rstone","NULL","2","0","Replication data for: Lending Credibility: The International Monetary Fund and the Post-Communist Transition, 2002","Randall Stone Dataverse","2011-04-19T00:00:00Z","Randall Stone Dataverse","s3://1902.1/10104","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T06:51:00Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LAXKLR","43677","RELEASED"

In this historical analysis, we find that states with competitive party systems spend more than other states—and specifically spend more on education, health, and transportation, areas identified as investments in human capital and infrastructure. We find that this spending leads to longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, better educational outcomes, and higher incomes.

Nativists take up the cause of sub-national groups, vilifying other regions and groups within the country as sources of migration. Since the 1970s, the majority of less-developed countries have adopted policies that aim to limit internal migration.

This tradeoff provides a previously unrecognized rationale for coalition formation in elections. We take our model to data from Mexican municipal elections between 1995-2016 and show that coalitions between parties on opposite ends of the ideology spectrum have served as an instrument of democratic consolidation.","163","doi:10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","ajps","c(""Electoral coalitions"", ""Entrenched incumbency"", ""Dynamic electoral competition"", ""Regression discontinuity design"", ""Structural estimation"")","1","1","Replication Data for: Sleeping with the Enemy: Effective Representation Under Dynamic Electoral Competition","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","2021-10-08T13:58:46Z","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-10-08T14:03:47Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","274944","RELEASED"

However, a recent literature shows that some benefits can have a countervailing effect in environments plagued by clientelism: by permanently boosting voters’ incomes, irrevocable and durable benefits might reduce the voters’ dependence on incumbents. This article explains how parties strategically allocate these benefits when trading off the income effect relative to the standard electoral rewards of redistribution. The theory highlights a previously unstudied rationale to target opposition areas: to weaken voters’ dependence on machines. The framework is tested with administrative data on the allocation of cisterns by state governments across Brazilian semi-arid municipalities, where clientelism is rampant. States favor areas governed by copartisans, but only where local clientelistic mobilization is weak. Where it is strong, states favor municipalities led by the opposition, while avoiding their own local strongholds.","22","doi:10.7910/DVN/UMP7YP","ajps","c(""Clientelism"", ""Redistribution"")","1","1","Replication Data for: Strategic Allocation of Irrevocable and Durable Benefits","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","2020-10-29T19:23:09Z","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/UMP7YP","Social Sciences","dataset","2022-11-22T13:26:20Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UMP7YP","335497","RELEASED"

We argue that revisionist states have incentives to make territorial claims when the great powers that manage the system are in crisis. We identify five main sources of systemic instability and develop measures of each of them, demonstrating that the majority of territorial claims in Europe are drawn at times when regional great powers are embroiled in crisis, e.g., 1848 or 1870 during the 19th century. Importantly, the claims that emerge at these times are not necessarily among states involved in the crises that generated turmoil in the system, e.g., Prussia and France in 1870. Moreover, we use a newly developed spatial measure of historical boundary precedents in Europe from 1650-1790 to demonstrate that the effect of this known spatial correlate of where claims are drawn only matters when the European system is in crisis. We further demonstrate that this pattern of claim-timing is general to the global system of states. Finally, we corroborate our explanation of our findings with a detailed case study of the territorial claims that led to the formation of the contemporary Italian state.","27","doi:10.7910/DVN/SYJZNG","IOJ","NULL","1","0","Replication Data for: Systemic Instability and the Emergence of Border Disputes","International Organization (IO) Journal Dataverse","2020-02-27T05:38:17Z","International Organization (IO) Journal Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/SYJZNG","Social Sciences","dataset","2020-02-27T05:38:17Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SYJZNG","187741","RELEASED"

However, theoretical models of how contributions are allocated during the electoral cycle have been lacking. Our analysis attempts to remedy this gap by providing and testing a model which specifies how the process of bargaining between members of Congress and organized interests produces the pattern of donations observed over the course of the electoral cycle. Most notably, our results suggest that strategic incumbents can receive money early in the campaign if they desire but that they are generally unwilling to pay the price of lower aggregate fundraising and greater provision of access. These findings buttress earlier empirical findings that question the instrumental value of early money. In addition, our results highlight that contribution choices are fundamentally influenced by short-term factors, especially electoral conditions, that do not lend themselves to the routinized behavior necessary for contributors to invest in incumbents for long-run payoffs.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/3LOTUL","pan","NULL","1","0","Replication data for: The Time to Give: PAC Motivations and Electoral Timing","Political Analysis Dataverse","2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","Political Analysis Dataverse","s3://1902.1/13971","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T06:53:25Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/3LOTUL","44038","RELEASED"

Here, we focus on one determinant corresponding to the former critique—nominee ideology—and another corresponding to the latter—the independence of decision-makers in the targeted agencies. We examine a series of theoretically-driven hypotheses regarding the effects of both ideology and independence on who gets nominated and if and when nominees are eventually confirmed. Results show nominee ideology and decision-maker independence matter a great deal and factor into Presidential strategic choices and Senatorial responses in ways according to expectations.

We are pleased that dGG's analyses are consistent with the theoretical conjecture about international conflict put forward in BKZ --- ""The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large stable and replicable whenever the ex ante probability of conflict is large"" (BKZ, p.21) --- and that dGG agree with our main methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting performance should always be one of the standards used to judge s tudies of international conflict, and indeed most other areas of political science. However, dGG frequently err when they draw methodological conclusions. Their central claim involves the superiority of logit over neural network models for international conflict data, as judged by forecasting performance and other properties such as ease of use and interpretation (""neural networks hold few unambiguous advantages... and carry significant costs"" relative to logit; dGG, p.14). We show here that this claim, which would be regarded as stunning in any of the diverse f ields in which both methods are more commonly used, is false. We also show that dGG's methodological errors and the restrictive model they favor cause them to miss and mischaracterize crucial patterns in the causes of international conflict. We begin in the next section by summarizing the growing support for our conjecture about international conflict. The second section discusses the theoretical reasons why neural networks dominate logistic regression, correcting a number of methodological errors. The third section then demonstrates empirically, in the same data as used in BKZ and dGG, that neural networks substantially outperform dGG's logit model. We show that neural networks improve on the forecasts from logit as much as logit improves on a model with no theoretical variables. We also show how dGG's logit analysis assumed, rather than estimated, the answer to the central question about the literature's most important finding, the effect of democracy on war. Since this and other substantive assumptions underlying their logit model are wrong, their substantive conclusion about the democratic peace is also wrong. The neural network models we used in BKZ not only avoid these difficulties, but they, or one of the other methods available that do not make highly restrictive assumptions about the exact functional form, are just what is called for to study the observable implications of our conjecture.

To show this, we characterize the preference aggregation rule implied by the AMCE and demonstrate its several undesirable properties. With this result we provide a method for placing bounds on the proportion of experimental subjects who prefer a given candidate-feature. We describe conditions under which the AMCE corresponds in sign with the majority preference.

Studying post–World War II independence cases, we statistically examine consequences of postwar decolonization—which includes both colonial autonomy and independence—for democracy, internal conflict, government revenue growth, and economic growth using two-way fixed-effects models. We find that democracy levels increased sharply as colonies gained internal autonomy in the period immediately before their independence. However, conflict, revenue growth, and economic growth did not systematically differ before and after independence. Accounting for varieties of colonial institutions or for endogenous independence timing produces similar results. Except for democratic gains, the overall findings—juxtaposed with existing research—suggest that, although European colonial empires created deleterious long-term effects, decolonization exhibited less pronounced political consequences than sometimes thought.","8","doi:10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","isq","Decolonization, Economic Development, Political Development,","1","0","Replication Data for: What Were the Consequences of Decolonization?","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","2020-01-13T14:50:08Z","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","Social Sciences","dataset","2020-01-13T14:50:08Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","179721","RELEASED"

To test this argument, we develop the most comprehensive dataset to date on women MPs and gender differences in voter support across Europe and over time, covering 187 parties in 30 countries from 1985 to 2018. Our analyses confirm that RRP parties engage in strategic descriptive representation when they are both struggling electorally and suffering from a gender gap in support. Additional models reveal that this tactic is largely unique to RRP parties.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/SG55BJ","the_review","gender and politics, representation, political parties, gender gap, strategic descriptive representation, radical right populist parties","1","0","Replication Data for: When do Männerparteien Elect Women?

While an audience costs approach assumes that the punishment for reneging is automatic, we model the choice of exchange rate policy in the shadow of elections as a signaling game between voters and governments, where governments have private information and voters are rational. We find that voters draw different inferences when they see reneging by different actors, and only Left governments are punished for breaking their promises. We test this hypothesis in the context of the post-Communist countries from 1990 to 2007 and find that Left governments were more likely to fall if they reneged on exchange rate commitments, but Right governments were not.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","isq","NULL","1","0","Risky Signals: The Political Costs of Exchange Rate Policy in Post-Communist Countries","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","2018-07-05T19:07:30Z","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","Social Sciences","dataset","2018-07-05T19:07:30Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","138437","RELEASED"

Couples had to have started living together, gotten engaged or married within the last year or planned to do so in the next year. The objective of the project was to study ‘newly committed’ couples over time as they pursued important goals related to their ideal self. A wide range of diverse measurements were assessed, making this dataset suitable for investigating a wide variety of topics, and not just on goal pursuits. See the long list of publications that have already used this dataset. Measures include those related to the ideal self and goal support (e.g., some Michelangelo phenomenon measures), general relationship processes and well-being (e.g., commitment, trust, DAS, perceived partner responsiveness, etc.), and general self processes (e.g., personal well-being, some health measures, self-esteem, narcissism, self-control, etc.) Many of the Michelangelo measures and relationship measures also had both partners complete measures about their own behavior as well as equivalent perceived partner behaviors. Please see the separate measures list for details. 187 couples began the study and 98 couples completed the final wave. At waves 1, 3, and 5, couples came into the lab (or some completed questionnaires online if they were unable to attend the lab session) and at waves 2 and 4, couples completed mailed questionnaires. At waves 1 and 5, couples engaged in video-taped discussions about their most important goal, and at wave 3, couples completed a 8-day diary study after the lab session.

This is a market research firm which specializes in providing newspapers, television affiliates and cable operators with market segmentation research pertinent to consumer purchasing patterns and the effective marketing of goods and services to program audiences. The data in the Stowell Archive were collected via random digit dialing and computer-aided telephone interviews (CATI). Most of the surveys focus on the marketing needs of mass media clients and contain demographics, psychographics, media exposure information, and purchasing behavior data about consumers in major metropolitan areas of the United States and Canada starting in 1989. The sample sizes of the surveys range from 500 to 3,000 respondents, averaging 1,000 observations per study. Data are available at the respondent level, and all observations are keyed to zip code or other geographic identifiers. Additional surveys are anticipated, with over twenty new media marke t studies being donated annually. The University's relationship with Leigh Stowell & Company, Inc. was cultivated by Dr. Nicholas Lovrich, Director of WSU's Division of Governmental Studies and Services (DGSS) and by Dr. John Pierce, former Dean of the WSU College of Liberal Arts over the course of a decade. DGSS collaborated with WSU Libraries Digital Services to process the gifted data files into this digital archive which features powerful search and download capabilities. Further refinement of the archive in accordance with the Data Documentation Initiative is progressing with support from the Office of the Provost, the College of Liberal Arts and the WSU Libraries.

However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly colli- sional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in gal- axy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a sys- tem in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a reduction of heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading to large temperature variations on small spatial scales (as is seen in cluster plasmas).","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","MIT-PSFC","c(""heat flux densities"", ""heat transport"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetized plasma"", ""plasma physics"")","1","0","Strong suppression of heat conduction in a laboratory replica of galaxy-cluster turbulent plasmas","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-11-03T13:18:04Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","Physics","dataset","2022-11-03T13:18:04Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","328322","RELEASED"

Study measures were administered in the subject’s home or the clinic by unblinded, trained research assistants at study entry and 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months later. Sociodemographic information obtained at baseline included age, sex, education level, marital status, living condition, employment status, religion and economic satisfaction. Our primary outcome variables were depression symptom severity, and HTN control. The measure of depressive symptom change was a valid and reliable Chinese translation of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS). Items for analysis included response to treatment, defined as a ≥50% change in the HDRS score from baseline, and remission of depression defined as a total HDRS score <10 at follow-up. BP was measured at baseline and each follow-up point according to standards developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The primary variable for analysis was dichotomous – controlled vs. uncontrolled HTN. Consistent with the Hypertension Treatment Guidelines, uncontrolled HTN was defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 or diastolic BP ≥ 80 for patients with diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease or renal disease, and BP ≥ 140 or diastolic BP≥90 for all others. Variables known to influence response to treatment of depression or HTN were included as covariates: the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is associated with hypertension treatment response, and the WHOQOL-BREF for quality of life, which is a widely used measure and the Chinese version of which has shown very good psychometric properties. As a measure of functioning independent of the WHOQOL-BREF physical domain score, we assessed the subject’s impairment in basic (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

Will a voter with concrete---as opposed to hypothetical---knowledge about other voters' political knowledge have an increased incentive to participate? Or instead, will concrete social knowledge about other voters actually inhibit participation? In this article, we develop a novel experimental design that focuses on whether concrete knowledge about other voters' political knowledge influences political participation. Our main result shows that concrete social knowledge decreases individual voters' willingness to vote, and thereby reduces the probability democracy chooses the majority preferred alternative, i.e. the quality of democratic choice.","5","doi:10.7910/DVN/HWGLUJ","PSRM","NULL","1","0","The Concreteness of Social Knowledge and the Quality of Democratic Choice","Political Science Research and Methods (PSRM) Dataverse","2021-10-02T22:32:23Z","Political Science Research and Methods (PSRM) Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/HWGLUJ","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-10-02T22:32:23Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HWGLUJ","272728","RELEASED"

The intent was to amass as much information on as many of the teachers as possible in order to, first, answer a number of historical questions about the teachers and, second, to measure the black response to educational opportunity. The project employs prosopography, or collective biography, to reveal commonalities and exceptions among the teachers. Originally imagined as a study of perhaps five thousand teachers, it grew to embrace every identifiable teacher in black schools during the focus time period, numbering now just shy of twelve thousand individuals. The conclusions that have been drawn have surprised, and usually delighted, activists and scholars working in black education, the social history of teachers and teaching, women’s history, social history, and teacher education.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/0HBDZD","jsdp","Slavery","1","2","The Freedmen’s Teacher Project: Teachers among the Freed People in the U.S. South, 1861-1877","Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation Dataverse","2022-06-30T19:53:05Z","Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/0HBDZD","Arts and Humanities","dataset","2023-04-18T16:51:13Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0HBDZD","344015","RELEASED"

It documents the life of Monica, an American woman born with congenital atrasia of the esophagus who was fed by a gastric fistula until 2 years of age when corrective surgery was performed. The project began in October of 1953 when Drs. Franz Reichsman and George Engel met Monica, age 15 months, while she was hospitalized for retarded growth and development, depression and malnutrition. What began then as a limited case study of depression in an infant with a gastric fistula expanded into an intensive, multimethod, multimedia, longitudinal exploration of her life. After filming and testing Monica during this nine month hospital stay, the research team continued to follow her development after reconstructive surgery of the esophagus at age two, into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Monica married at age 19 and bore four daughters over the next seven years. Data collection of Monica, her mother, siblings, husband and four children, continued until Murray Center acquisition of the data in 1995. Investigators anticipate continued contact with Monica and her family in the future. The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (11 hours of silent film (transferred to video) dating from 1953 to 1976; 40 hours of video, dating from 1972 to 1994; 232 interviews (with Monica and family members); 252 psychological tests (including projective, personality, and intelligence tests of Monica and family); 464 notes from observation of laboratory testing sessions, 39 notes from phone conversations; 148 transcripts of laboratory sessions; 57 pieces of artwork (by Monica, her siblings, and her children); 36 items of correspondence; 30 experiments; 56 medical notes; 6 newspaper articles; 145 other notes and items; 1586 photographs; and 248 audiotapes of laboratory sessions).

A theoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas (Pm<1). However, the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate differently when Pm≳1, the regime relevant to many astrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. This paper reports an experiment that creates a laboratory Pm≳1 plasma dynamo. We provide a time-resolved characterization of the plasma’s evolution, measuring temperatures, densities, flow velocities, and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages of the fluctuation dynamo’s operation on seed magnetic fields generated by the action of the Biermann-battery mechanism during the initial drive-laser target interaction. The magnetic energy in structures with characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude and saturate dynamically. It is shown that the initial growth of these fields occurs at a much greater rate than the turnover rate of the driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently at the driving scale than anticipated by idealized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale fields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","MIT-PSFC","c(""fluctuation duo"", ""fluctuation dynamo"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetic fields"", ""MHD"", ""turbulent plasmas"")","1","0","Time-resolved turbulent dynamo in a laser plasma","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","Physics","dataset","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","283704","RELEASED"

When scaled to National Ignition Facility laser energies of 1.9 MJ, these targets are predicted to produce a fusion energy output of ~500 kJ—several times larger than current fusion yields achieved at that facility. Future applications of this approach will guide the exploration of the vast parameter space for the conditions required for thermonuclear ignition and expose gaps in our understanding of laser-fusion physics.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""machine learning"", ""omega laser laboratory for laser energetics"", ""radiation hydrodynamics"")","1","0","Tripled yield in direct-drive laser fusion through statistical modelling","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2019-03-11T17:27:35Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","Physics","dataset","2019-03-11T17:27:35Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","151033","RELEASED"

The Value Study was a partnership of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Middle Atlantic Region (NN/LM MAR) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The study built on the “Rochester study” conducted in the early 1990s by Marshall and a study team from the Rochester, NY area. The planning group spent considerable time considering changes in the health sciences information environment since the Rochester study was conducted. This study updates the Rochester design and methods. The study employed multiple methods, both quantitative and qualitative. The Value Study used a multi-stage research design with a pilot phase involving 7 library sites. The full study included 56 library sites serving 118 hospitals. Using the Critical Incident Technique, the survey captured data on a recent incident in which health professionals searched for information related to a patient care situation. or patient care, information resources and access points used and impact of the information. The survey invitation was sent via listservs to physicians, residents and nurses in the participating hospitals. Based on estimates provided by the study facilitator at each hospital, the total number of physicians, residents and nurses served by the 56 library sites was approximately 172,463. On that basis, the 16,122 responses represent an overall response rate of 10%. The response rate for physicians was 10% (n=5,379), for residents 12% (2,123) and for nurses 7% (n=6,788). Response rates by site varied considerably with 21 sites having a survey response rate of 10% or less, 25 sites had a response rate of 11% to 20% and 10 sites had a response rate of 21% or more.","6","hdl:1902.29/11096","odum","NULL","NA","NA","Value of library and information services in patient care","ODUM Harvested  Dataverse","2020-01-22T07:00:57Z","ODUM Harvested  Dataverse","s3://1902.29/11096","list()","dataset","2020-02-12T16:52:51Z","https://hdl.handle.net/1902.29/11096","182319","RELEASED"

However, it is also too blunt; there is widespread recognition that democracy is multifaceted and that backsliding, when it occurs, tends to be piecemeal. To address these concerns, we provide original data from surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of dimensions during the first year and a half of the Trump presidency. We draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing. We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify potential areas of agreement – bright lines – among experts and the public about the most important democratic principles and whether they have been violated. Public and expert perceptions often differ on the importance of specific democratic principles. In addition, though our experts perceive substantial democratic erosion, particularly in areas related to checks and balances, polarization between Trump supporters and opponents undermines any social consensus recognizing these violations.","15","doi:10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","perspectives","Democracy, democratic erosion, Trump","1","0","Vol. 17(3)- Replication Data for: Searching for Bright Lines in the Trump Presidency","Perspectives on Politics","2019-03-08T13:07:41Z","Perspectives on Politics","s3://10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","Social Sciences","dataset","2019-03-08T13:07:41Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","149274","RELEASED"

This year, for the first time, the German Marshall Fund of the United States partnered with the Chicago Council to undertake a parallel study in six European countries: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the Netherlands. In particular, this study covered three topics: perceptions of citizens of the countries and the problems they face, the roles of the United States and the European Union (EU) in the world, and attitudes toward geopolitics and globalization. Regarding perceptions of citizens of the countries and the problems they face, respondents were asked to give their opinions on persisting friendliness of the countries toward each other, common perceptions of threats, support for multilateralism, readiness to use military force, resolve to combat terrorism, and support for NATO and its expansion. On the topic of the roles of the United States and the EU in the world, respondents were asked their feelings about United States leadership in the world, support for the EU playing a more prominent international role, w hether the EU should become a superpower, and what role the EU should play militarily in the world. Concerning geopolitics and globalization, respondents were asked their opinions about Iraq, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Russia, the rise of China as a world power, the impact of globalization, and trade.

A national sample of high school seniors and their parents was first surveyed in 1965. Subsequent surveys of the same individuals were conducted in 1973, 1982, and 1997. This data collection combines all four waves of youth data for the study. The general objective of the data collection was to study the dynamics of political attitudes and behaviors by obtaining data on the same individuals as they aged from approximately 18 years of age in 1965 to 50 years of age in 1997. Especially when combined with other elements of the study as released in other ICPSR collections in the Youth Studies Series, this data collection facilitates the analysis of generational, life cycle, and historical effects and political influences on relationships within the family. This data collection also has several distinctive properties. First, it is a longitudinal study of a particular cohort, a national sample from the graduating high school class of 1965. Second, it captures the respondents at key points in their life stages -- at ages 18, 26, 35, and 50. Third, the dataset contains many replicated measures over time as well as some measures unique to each data point. Fourth, there is detailed information about the respondents' life histories. Background variables include age, sex, religious orientation, level of religious participation, marital status, ethnicity, educational status and background, place of residence, family income, and employment status.","1","doi:10.3886/ICPSR04037.v1","icpsr","c(""adolescents"", ""family life"", ""family relations"", ""high school students"", ""high schools"", ""life events"", ""parent child relationship"", ""peer groups"", ""personality"", ""political attitudes"", ""political behavior"", ""political change"", ""political participation"", ""political partisanship"", ""political socialization"", ""public policy"", ""social attitudes"", ""social behavior"", ""social protest"", ""social studies"", ""student attitudes"", ""trust in government"")","NA","NA","Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, 1965-1997: Four Waves Combined","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T03:29:23Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR04037.v1","","dataset","2015-04-09T03:29:23Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04037.v1","35980","RELEASED"

In some experiments, the filtering is insufficient to block these ions and the fusion-product signal tracks are lost in the large background of accelerated ion tracks. A technique for recovering signal in these scenarios has been developed, tested, and implemented successfully. The technique involves removing material from the surface of the CR-39 to a depth beyond the endpoint of the ablator ion tracks.

Inter-species ion diffusion has been suggested as a possible cause of the observed yield degradation in fuel mixture implosions. An experimental platform utilizing hydro-equivalent deuterium-tritium (DT), deuterium-tritium-hydrogen (DTH), and deuterium-tritium-helium3 (DT3He) capsule implosions was developed to determine whether the inter-species ion diffusion theory may describe the resulting fuel mixture implosion behavior. The implosion experiments were performed at the Omega laser facility. X-ray images and shell areal density diagnostics results show that the hydro-equivalent three capsules (DT, DTH, and DT3He) have similar compression behavior. However, nuclear yield deviation was observed from the scaling determined using a fusion yield formula. In the DT3He mixture, a reduced yield of a factor of 0.65 ± 0.13 was observed, which is similar to a yield reduction observed in D3He mixture by Rygg et al. (i.e, Rygg effect). In contrast, in the DTH mixture, a factor of 1.17 ± 0.15 yield increase was observed, which we named the inverse Rygg effect. The yield increase observed in the DTH mixture is consistent with the inter-species ion diffusion theory where lighter H diffuses away from the core and concentrated DT in the core produces higher yield. An inter-species ion diffusion model, the Zimmerman-Paquette-Kagan-Zhdanov (ZPKZ) model, implemented in a Lagrangian radiation-hydrodynamics fluid code, was also used to analyze the present data, without the need to assume hydrodynamic equivalence of the capsules, but it does not completely explain the DTH or DT3He capsules, although its effects are in the correct direction. Simulation-based Bayesian inference was used in the latter analysis to quantify the uncertainty in the numerical simulations. The simulation-based analysis resulted in an inferred Rygg-effect yield decrease factor of 0.91 ± 0.02 for the DT3He mixture, and an inferred inverse-Rygg yield increase factor of 1.21 ± 0.04 for the DTH mixture, based on simulations ignoring ion diffusion.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/NRARAK","MIT-PSFC","c(""areal density"", ""direct drive"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""radiation hydrodynamics simulation"", ""yield anomaly"")","2","0","First Observation of Increased DT Yield over Prediction due to Addition of Hydrogen","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-01-01T14:13:11Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/NRARAK","Physics","dataset","2022-01-01T14:13:11Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NRARAK","300050","RELEASED"

These asymmetries seed flows in the implosions, which will manifest as modifications to the measured ion temperature (Tion) as inferred from the broadening of primary neutron spectra. The effects are important to understand both to learn to control and mitigate low-mode asymmetries, and to experimentally more closely capture thermal Tion used as input in implosion performance metric calculations. In this paper, results from and simulations of a set of experiments with a seeded mode 2 in the laser drive are described. The goal of this intentionally asymmetrically driven experiment was to test our capability to predict and measure the signatures of flows seeded by the low-mode asymmetry. The results from these experiments (first discussed in M Gatu Johnson et al, Phys. Rev. E 98, 051201(R) (2018)) demonstrate the importance of interplay of flows seeded by various asymmetry seeds. In particular, measured Tion and self-emission x-ray asymmetries are expected to be well captured by interplay between flow seeded by the imposed mode 2 and the capsule stalk mount. Measurements of areal density asymmetry also indicate the importance of the stalk mount as an asymmetry seed in these implosions. The simulations brought to bear on the problem (1D LILAC, 2D xRAGE, 3D ASTER and 3D Chimera) show how thermal Tion is expected to be significantly lower than Tion as inferred from the broadening of measured neutron spectra. They also show that the electron temperature is not expected to be the same as Tion for these implosions.","43","doi:10.7910/DVN/6E9ONS","MIT-PSFC","c(""areal density"", ""direct drive"", ""flow"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""neutron spectrometry"", ""omega laser laboratory for laser energetics"", ""radiation hydrodynamics"", ""x-ray imaging"")","1","0","Impact of imposed mode 2 laser drive asymmetry on inertial confinement fusion implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2019-03-18T18:47:48Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/6E9ONS","Physics","dataset","2019-03-18T18:47:48Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6E9ONS","151287","RELEASED"

Here we report a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of anti-parallel magnetically driven reconnection using high-power lasers. The ion acoustic bursts are followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. We reproduce these observations with one- and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in which an electron outfow jet drives ion acoustic instabilities, forming double layers. These layers induce electron two-stream instabilities that generate electron acoustic bursts and energize electrons.

However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly colli- sional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in gal- axy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a sys- tem in a laser laboratory experiment.

A theoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas (Pm<1). However, the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate differently when Pm≳1, the regime relevant to many astrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. This paper reports an experiment that creates a laboratory Pm≳1 plasma dynamo. We provide a time-resolved characterization of the plasma’s evolution, measuring temperatures, densities, flow velocities, and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages of the fluctuation dynamo’s operation on seed magnetic fields generated by the action of the Biermann-battery mechanism during the initial drive-laser target interaction. The magnetic energy in structures with characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude and saturate dynamically. It is shown that the initial growth of these fields occurs at a much greater rate than the turnover rate of the driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently at the driving scale than anticipated by idealized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale fields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","MIT-PSFC","c(""fluctuation duo"", ""fluctuation dynamo"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetic fields"", ""MHD"", ""turbulent plasmas"")","1","0","Time-resolved turbulent dynamo in a laser plasma","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","Physics","dataset","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","283704","RELEASED"

Opinions were sought on the relative influence of party leaders and staff, among others, in determining legislative outcomes, and how much attention party leaders should give to various duties. Additional questions asked whether respondents followed their conscience or the wishes of their constituency when making decisions, the political views of their constituency, and which groups they considered to be their strongest supporters.

We develop a general, repeated public-goods model. We then allow the qualitative dimensions of cooperation to emerge endogenously: agreements can have broad or narrow membership and entail deep or shallow commitments; they can be multilateral or discriminatory; they can be ad hoc or institutionalized. We find that the relationship between the distribution of power and international cooperation is complex: a large leading state forms a narrow coalition of intensive contributors, and builds institutions, while a smaller leading state forms a broader coalition that makes shallow contributions, and is more inclined to multilateralism.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/DQ4SCA","slantchev","NULL","2","0","Choosing How to Cooperate: A Repeated Public-Goods Model of International Relations","Branislav Slantchev Dataverse","2011-06-15T00:00:00Z","Branislav Slantchev Dataverse","s3://1902.1/11153","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T07:53:45Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DQ4SCA","55716","RELEASED"

The measurements from these experiments are generally highly integrated and require unique analysis techniques to procure quantitative information. This work describes a methodology to constrain the physics in convergent HED experiments by adapting the methods common to many other fields of physics. As an example, a mechanical model of an imploding shell is constrained by data from a thin-shelled direct-drive exploding-pusher experiment on the OMEGA Laser System using Bayesian inference, resulting in the reconstruction of the shell dynamics and energy transfer during the implosion. The model is tested by analyzing synthetic data from a 1-D hydrodynamics code and is sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a general methodology that can be used to draw conclusions from a wide variety of HED experiments.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","MIT-PSFC","c(""Bayesian Analysis"", ""high pressure"", ""Inertial confinement fusion [ICF]"", ""modelling"", ""plasma"")","2","0","Constraining Physical Models at Gigabar Pressures","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2021-11-18T14:09:41Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","Physics","dataset","2021-11-18T14:09:41Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/R3SHSK","283834","RELEASED"

This study evaluated the accuracy of an integrated proteomic classifier in identifying benign nodules in patients with a pretest probability of cancer (pCA) ≤ 50%. Methods: A prospective, multicenter observational trial of 685 patients with 8- to 30-mm lung nodules was conducted. Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was used to measure the relative abundance of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A. Results were integrated with a clinical risk prediction model to identify likely benign nodules. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value were calculated. Estimates of potential changes in invasive testing had the integrated classifier results been available and acted on were made. Results: A subgroup of 178 patients with a clinician-assessed pCA ≤ 50% had a 16% prevalence of lung cancer. The integrated classifier demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% (CI, 82-100), a specificity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and a negative predictive value of 98% (CI, 92-100) in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules. The classifier performed better than PET, validated lung nodule risk models, and physician cancer probability estimates (P < .001). If the integrated classifier results were used to direct care, 40% fewer procedures would be performed on benign nodules, and 3% of malignant nodules would be misclassified. Conclusions: When used in patients with lung nodules with a pCA ≤ 50%, the integrated classifier accurately identifies benign lung nodules with good performance characteristics. If used in clinical practice, invasive procedures could be reduced by diverting benign nodules to surveillance.

The electron energy deposition profile in the fuel is inferred through dedicated experiments using Cu-doped payloads of varying thickness. The measured preheat energy accurately explains the areal-density degradation observed in many OMEGA implosions. This technique can be used to assess the viability of the direct-drive approach to laser fusion with respect to the scaling of hot-electron preheat with laser energy.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/PEH7OP","MIT-PSFC","c(""areal densities"", ""direct measurement"", ""electron energies"", ""fusion implosions"", ""hot electron energy deposition"", ""laser energies"", ""laser-plasma instabilities"", ""varying thickness"")","2","0","Direct Measurements of DT Fuel Preheat from Hot Electrons in Direct-Drive Inertial Confinement Fusion","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-07-28T13:31:04Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/PEH7OP","Physics","dataset","2022-07-28T13:31:04Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PEH7OP","330488","RELEASED"

Experimental yields on the OMEGA Laser System, however, have shown much less sensitivity to this initial target offset. This paper presents simulations of offset ICF implosions improved by including a physics model of cross-beam energy transfer (CBET), a mechanism of laser energy scattering from one beam to another. Room-temperature OMEGA implosion experiments with prescribed target offsets are simulated with and without CBET, illustrating that CBET mitigates the ℓ = 1 implosion asymmetry from target offset. Comparison of simulations to multiple complementary experimental observables indicates the addition of CBET physics in offset simulations is necessary to match experimental results.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","MIT-PSFC","c(""capsule offsets"", ""cross beam energy transfer"", ""direct drive"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""radiation hydrodynamics simulation"")","2","0","Effect of cross-beam energy transfer on target-offset asymmetry in direct-drive inertial confinement fusion implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2021-11-17T14:11:34Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","Physics","dataset","2021-11-17T14:11:34Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FQQP9I","283784","RELEASED"

One person was randomly assigned to be the discloser of good news: Experimenters incorporated the participants' answers from the initial questionnaire and indicated to disclosers they had been hypothetically hired for their “dream” job or accepted into their “dream” graduate program. The other members of the romantic dyads—the responders—were informed that their partners received this good news. After role assignment, we implemented a manipulation of the conversation context. In the noncorrespondent condition, couples were told to imagine having to live apart from their partners and endure a long- distance relationship. The news was noncorrespondent for disclosers because the pursuit of their dream job (i.e., self-directed goal) conflicted with their relationship-directed goal. The news was also non- correspondent for responders who would have to endure a long-distance relationship so that their partners could pursue their dream jobs. In the correspondent condition, couples were told to imagine they could live together, with the news being positive for disclosers, responders, and the relationship.

Scaled laboratory experiments studying the interaction of an inflowing solar wind analog with a strong, external magnetic field are a promising new way to study magnetospheric physics and to complement existing models, although reaching regimes favorable for magnetized shock formation is experimentally challenging. This paper presents experimental evidence of the formation of a magnetized bow shock in the interaction of a supersonic, super-Alfvenic plasma with a strongly magnetized obstacle at the OMEGA laser facility. The solar wind analog is generated by the collision and subsequent expansion of two counter- propagating, laser-driven plasma plumes. The magnetized obstacle is a thin wire, driven with strong electrical currents. Hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code predict that the colliding plasma source meets the criteria for bow shock formation. Spatially resolved, optical Thomson scat- tering measures the electron number density, and optical emission lines provide a measurement of the plasma temperature, from which we infer the presence of a fast magnetosonic shock far upstream of the obstacle. Proton images provide a measure of large-scale features in the magnetic field topology, and reconstructed path-integrated magnetic field maps from these images suggest the formation of a bow shock upstream of the wire and as a transient magnetopause. We compare features in the reconstructed fields to two-dimensional MHD simulations of the system.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","MIT-PSFC","c(""bow shock"", ""FLASH"", ""hydrodynamic simulation"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetospheric physics"")","2","0","Experimental observations of detached bow shock formation in the interaction of a laser-produced plasma with a magnetized obstacle","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2023-01-01T14:05:53Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","Physics","dataset","2023-01-01T14:05:53Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/X3PB10","337641","RELEASED"

This paper analyses a new panel dataset of local public goods provision in a single North Indian district with observations at the village-decade level going back to 1905 and detailed information on colonial land tenure institutions and demographics. The presence of large colonial landowners is positively associated with rural public goods provision when the landlord was resident in the early 20th century, and has a null effect when the landlord was an absentee. Villages inhabited or owned by upper castes had an advantage in the colonial and immediate post-independence eras, but not afterwards. The results suggest that within unequal societies, economic and status inequalities can have positive effects on public goods provision when they link elites to extra-local decisionmakers.","7","doi:10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","cps","NULL","1","0","Historical Inequality at the Grassroots:  Local Public Goods in an Indian District, 1905-2011","Comparative Political Studies Dataverse","2023-01-09T13:40:44Z","Comparative Political Studies Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","Social Sciences","dataset","2023-01-09T13:40:44Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VSRNFS","336570","RELEASED"

A technique to quantify the hot electron preheat of the dense DT fuel and connect it to the degradation in areal density is described in detail. Hot electrons are measured primarily from the hard x-rays they emit as they slow down in the target. The DT preheat is inferred from a comparison of the hard x-ray signals between a DT-layered implosion and its mass equivalent ablator only implosion. The preheat energy spatial distribution within the imploding shell is inferred from experiments using high Z payloads of varying thicknesses. It is found that the electrons deposit their energy uniformly throughout the shell material. For typical direct-drive OMEGA implosions driven with an overlapped intensity of ∼9·10^14 W/cm2, approximately ∼0.02%–0.03% of the laser energy is converted into preheat of the stagnated fuel which corresponds to areal density degradations of 10%–20%. The degradations in areal density explain some of the observed discrepancies between the simulated and measured areal densities.","0","doi:10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive implosion"", ""hot electrons"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""OMEGA Laser Facility"", ""preheat"")","1","0","Inferences of hot electron preheat and its spatial distribution in OMEGA direct drive implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2023-02-28T18:46:26Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","Physics","dataset","2023-02-28T18:46:26Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MYIRKJ","341329","RELEASED"

These jets will also provide new versatile laser-based platforms to study magnetized shocks, shear flows, and other plasma processes under controllable conditions.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/GRVJWA","MIT-PSFC","c(""JET"", ""laboratory plasma"", ""laser-produced plasmas"", ""magnetic field generation"", ""stellar objects"")","1","0","Mega-Gauss Plasma Jet Creation Using a Ring of Laser Beams","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2020-06-16T20:27:01Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/GRVJWA","Physics","dataset","2020-06-16T20:27:01Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GRVJWA","197977","RELEASED"

Low-income, pregnant women bearing first babies were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: (1) subjects that received free transportation to prenatal care, (2) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care and developmental screening for the children, (3) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care and developmental screening, plus prenatal home visits by nurses, and (4) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care, developmental screening, prenatal home visits, and postnatal home visits by nurses. Assessments of the women covered health-related behaviors, mother's care-giving environment, child's health and development, levels of social support, mother's psychological resources, personal life-course development, and costs of health care. Variables measuring health-related behaviors included the use of cigarettes and illegal drugs and the presence of sexually-transmitted diseases. The mother's care-giving environment and the child's health and development were evaluated by the Bavolek adult-adolescent parenting interview score, the Caldwell home observation scale, the Bayley mental development index, the Achenbach child behavioral problems inventory, and other indices. Levels of social support were evaluated by the amount of support expected to be received from a boyfriend or husband and the mother's mother. Assessments of maternal psychological resources included the Pearlin mastery scale, the Shipley IQ score, and the Bandura self-efficacy score. Personal life-course development was assessed by the respondents' educational and occupational achievements, and the numbers of subsequent pregnancies and children. Variables measuring the effect of the program on the cost of health care include number of hospital emergency room visits, number of hospitalizations, total length of stay, number of well-child and ill-child doctor visits, and use of community social services. Other variables provide information on age at birth, pre-pregnancy weight, birth weight and gender, race, employment status, income, housing density, and education.","1","doi:10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","icpsr","c(""health behavior"", ""health care services"", ""prenatal care"", ""visiting nurses"")","NA","NA","Memphis New Mothers Study, 1990-1994","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","2015-04-09T03:14:26Z","ICPSR Harvested Dataverse","file://10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","","dataset","2015-04-09T03:14:26Z","https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR06782.v2","34623","RELEASED"

In this paper, the effects of asymmetric compression of cryogenic deuterium tritium laser-direct-drive implosions are examined using a suite of nuclear and x-ray diagnostics on the OMEGA laser. The neutron-averaged hot-spot velocity (~uhs) and apparent ion temperature (Ti) asymmetry are determined from neutron time-of-flight measurements of the primary deuterium tritium fusion neutron energy spectrum, while the areal density (rhoR) of the compressed fuel surrounding the hot spot is inferred from measurements of the scattered neutron energy spectrum. The low-mode perturbations of the hot-spot shape are characterized from x-ray self-emission images recorded along three quasi-orthogonal lines of sight. Implosions with significant mode-1 laser drive asymmetries show large hot-spot velocities (>100 km/s) in a direction consistent with the hot-spot elongation observed in x-ray images, measured Ti asymmetry, and rhoR asymmetry. Laser drive corrections have been applied through shifting the initial target location in order to mitigate the observed asymmetry. With the asymmetry corrected, a more-symmetric hot spot is observed with reduced ~uhs, Ti asymmetry, rhoR asymmetry, and a 30% increase in the fusion yield.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive implosion"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""low-mode asymmetry"", ""neutron spectrometry"", ""OMEGA Laser Facility"")","2","0","Mitigation of mode-one asymmetry in laser-direct-drive inertial confinement fusion implosions","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-04-01T13:27:05Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","Physics","dataset","2022-04-01T13:27:05Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JXSDJV","324071","RELEASED"

We propose that this stabil- ity is founded upon peaceful power sharing between the rebel regime leader and military elites. Amid long and intense fighting, rebel leaders must delegate control to top military commanders because doing so helps them to win battles. After seizing power, power-sharing deals between former combatants are highly credible due to their history of interactions, which mitigates the guardianship dilemma. Elsewhere, a persistent internal security dilemma often undermines power-sharing deals. Using originally collected data on African regimes from 1960–2017, we establish that rebel regimes break down seldomly compared to other authoritarian regimes, and experience fewer coups. Regarding the mechanism, rebel regimes more frequently share power with military elites by appointing a Minister of Defense. These Ministers are typically high-ranking members of the rebellion, which reflects the regime’s replacement of the state military with their own.","6","doi:10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","the_review","NULL","1","0","Power Sharing and Authoritarian Stability: How Rebel Regimes Solve the Guardianship Dilemma","American Political Science Review Dataverse","2022-04-13T14:00:47Z","American Political Science Review Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","Social Sciences","dataset","2022-04-13T14:00:47Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9","313703","RELEASED"

In the context of campaigns, for example, candidates continuously recalibrate their campaign strategy in response to polls and opponent actions. Traditional causal inference methods, however, assume that these dynamic decisions are made all at once, an assumption that forces a choice between omitted variable bias and post-treatment bias. Thus, these kinds of ""single-shot"" causal inference methods are inappropriate for dynamic processes like campaigns. I resolve this dilemma by adapting methods from biostatistics, thereby presenting a holistic framework for dynamic causal inference. I then use this method to estimate the effectiveness of an inherently dynamic process: a candidate's decision to ""go negative."" Drawing on U.S. statewide elections (2000-2006), I find, in contrast to the previous literature and alternative methods, that negative advertising is an effective strategy for non-incumbents.

This paper combines two approaches to sensitivity analysis to provide researchers with a tool to investigate how specific violations of no omitted variables alter their estimates. This approach can help researchers determine which narratives imply weaker results and which actually strengthen their claims. This gives researchers and critics a reasoned and quantitative approach to assessing the plausibility of causal effects.

Monte Carlo results demonstrate that for many applied research situations, this distribution is indeed highly peaked. The simulation further demonstrates that the proposed test has greater power than the Vuong test under these conditions. The substantive application addresses the effect of domestic political institutions on foreign policy decision making. Do domestic institutions have effects because they hold political leaders accountable, or do they simply promote political norms that shape elite bargaining behavior?

Although a single data generation process can produce all of these three data types, the statistical literature is not very helpful in providing methods to estimate parameters of the same process from each. In fact, only a single theoretical process exists for which known statistical methods can estimate the same parameters—and it is generally used only for count and duration data. The result is that seemingly trivial decisions about which level of data to use can have important consequences for substantive interpretations. We describe the theoretical event process for which results exist, based on time independence. We also derive a set of models for a time-dependent process and compare their predictions to those of a commonly used model. Any hope of understanding and avoiding the more serious problems of aggregation bias in events data is contingent on first deriving a much wider arsenal of statistical models and theoretical processes that are not constrained by the particular forms of data that happen to be available.

The Right is only competitive in poor regions when it matches the Left’s pro-poor policies. To credibly shift its position, it nominates candidates that are descriptively closer to the poor. Using a regression discontinuity design in Brazilian municipal elections, we show that Right-wing mayors spend less on the poor than Left-wing mayors only in low-poverty municipalities.

We explore the patterns of political influence over FDI using a comprehensive firm-level dataset on Chinese outward FDI from 2000-13. Using six country-level measures of affinity for China, we find that state-owned and globally diversified firms appear to conform most closely to official guidance.

The present paper reports the first study of stability properties of the Bonferroni and Benjamini–Hochberg procedures. The Bonferroni procedure shows a superior stability in terms of the variance of both the number of true discoveries and the total number of discoveries, a property that is especially important in the presence of correlations between individual p-values.

By circumscribing how far each party can legally bend the rules, legal bounds create reversion points if mutual forbearance collapses. If legal bounds are symmetric between parties, they deter electoral tilting by making credible each party's threat to punish transgressions by the other. If legal bounds become sufficiently asymmetric, however, the foundations for forbearance crumble. Asymmetries emerge when some groups (a) are more vulnerable than others to legally permissible electoral distortions and (b) favored and disfavored groups sort heavily into parties.

Analyzing new data on colonial legislatures in 144 colonies between the 17th and 20th centuries shows that only British settler colonies—emanating from a metropole with representative institutions—systematically exhibited early elected legislative representation. The second hypothesis highlights a core democratic contradiction even in colonies that established early representative institutions. Extending class-based democratization theories predicts perverse institutional evolution—resisted enfranchisement and contestation backsliding—because sizable European settler minorities usually composed an entrenched landed class, rejecting the heralded Dahlian path from competitive oligarchy to full democracy.

This paper is intended to demonstrate that the correlation structure of microarray data provides a rich source of useful information. We discuss distinct correlation substructures revealed in microarray gene expression data by an appropriate ordering of genes. These substructures include stochastic proportionality of expression signals in a large percentage of all gene pairs, negative correlations hidden in ordered gene triples, and a long sequence of weakly dependent random variables associated with ordered pairs of genes. The reported striking regularities are of general biological interest and they also have far-reaching implications for theory and practice of statistical methods of microarray data analysis. We illustrate the latter point with a method for testing differential expression of non-overlapping gene pairs. While designed for testing a different null hypothesis, this method provides an order of magnitude more accurate control of type 1 error rate compared to conventional methods of individual gene expre ssion profiling. In addition, this method is robust to the technical noise. Quantitative inference of the correlation structure has the potential to extend the analysis of microarray data far beyond currently practiced methods.","6","doi:10.7910/DVN/Z6UE8D","AOAS","c(""correlation structure"", ""gene expression"", ""microarrays"")","1","0","Replication data for: Diverse Correlation Structures in Microarray Gene Expression Data","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","2008-01-04T00:00:00Z","Annals of Applied Statistics Dataverse","s3://1902.1/10645","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T09:07:17Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Z6UE8D","66709","RELEASED"

Constituencies reserved for women are less likely than unreserved constituencies to elect members of groups where the status of women is low. In practice, this means they are less likely to elect members of several traditionally underprivileged groups (especially OBC castes) and more likely to elect candidates from the Hindu upper castes.

Electoral Studies. Abstract: What effect does party polarization have on voter turnout? Focusing largely on polarization as a (negative) indicator of party indifference, the existing empirical work has found mixed results. We re-examine this question, recognizing that polarization influences voters through perceptions of both alienation and indifference; we argue that the effect of polarization depends on the position of the voter relative to the party options. We introduce a new relative measure of polarization and test its effect on turnout in the two-rounds of the French presidential elections. We find that where a voter stands relative to the spread of party options is a significant predictor of turnout. If parties are either far away from the voter or are indistinguishable from each other, there is little incentive to turn out. On the other hand, party polarization leads to higher participation when the voter is close to one party and far from another.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","harvard","Turnout, Polarization, Alienation, Indifference, Runoff Elections, France","1","0","Replication Data for: Does Party Polarization Mobilize or De-Mobilize Voters?","Harvard Dataverse","2021-01-12T22:22:10Z","Harvard Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-01-12T22:22:10Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/7UYQEX","228015","RELEASED"

But what specific economic activities trigger such grievances, and why would governments not take proactive steps to limit economic grievances in order to stabilize their regimes? This article argues that specific economic activities—those that undermine a producer’s ability to exit the formal economy—cause governments to make taxation decisions that, despite the costliness of fighting, increase the likelihood of civil war. An inability for producers to exit the formal economy also undermines regional autonomy deals by encouraging governments to grab short-term rents despite the risk of triggering civil war. After deriving this “redistributive grievance” mechanism by analyzing an infinite-horizon bargaining model with endogenous labor supply and economic production, I address a specific empirical source of such redistributive grievances: oil-rich regions fight separatist civil wars relatively frequently. Capital-intense, geographically concentrated, and immobile oil production corresponds with conditions in the formal model that predict redistributive grievances and war. Moreover, I argue that applying the redistributive grievances mechanism to understanding the oil-separatism relationship also highlights shortcomings of alternative “greed”-based explanations.","8","doi:10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","harvard","Civil war, resource curse","1","0","Replication Data for: Economic Grievances and Civil War: An Application to the Resource Curse","Harvard Dataverse","2019-09-18T15:58:49Z","Harvard Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","Social Sciences","dataset","2019-09-18T15:58:49Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9OP7YH","174595","RELEASED"

In doing so, we provide evidence that both outcomes—the existence of constraining institutions and growth—are driven by initial conditions that fostered technical know-how embodied in urban-dwelling artisans who, in turn, were able to force institutional limits on rulers’ actions.

Abstract: Internal migration is thought to have substantial benefits for migrants and for the development of migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas. In order to facilitate such migration, central governments may need to use fiscal transfers to ensure services to migrants, address infrastructure shortfalls, and ameliorate labor market displacement of natives. In fact, an extensive, mostly normative ``fiscal federalism'' literature has argued that central governments ought to use transfers to reduce interjurisdictional externalities such as those due to population displacements. We extend this literature empirically by examining the degree to which exogenous, long-term migration prompts the redirection of central fiscal resources in India. Following the literature on distributive politics, we argue that transfers in decentralized systems addressing the costs of population movements are influenced by partisan politics. Using monsoon shocks to migration, we show that increases in migration are met with greater central transfers but that these flows are at least 50% greater if the state-level executive is in the Prime Minister's political party. Consistent with the theory, the influence of politics is greatest on parts of the budget subject to greater executive control. This politicization may explain why Indian states maintain barriers to internal migration despite the development costs of doing so.","2","doi:10.7910/DVN/TCGEDH","rbandbl","NULL","1","0","Replication Data for: Fiscal Federalism at Work?

I use a within-country research design to address this problem. During India’s reorganization as a linguistic federation, every language group could have sought a state. I show that representation in the ruling party conditioned the likelihood of a violent statehood movement. Pro-statehood groups that were politically advantaged over the interests opposed to them were peacefully accommodated. Statehood movements similar in political importance to their opponents used violence. Very politically-disadvantaged groups refrained from mobilization, anticipating repression.

Drawing on a novel dataset of judicial crises across eighteen Latin American countries following the third wave of democratization, we show that variation in judicial crises is systematically correlated with the president’s risk of non-electoral instability as captured by the history of past presidential crises, presidential power, and anti-governmental protests. To identify whether the effects of protest on judicial manipulation are causal, we use an instrumental variable approach based on international commodity prices weighted for each country. By treating institutional crises as inter-connected strategic decisions, this paper cuts against the tendency in the literature to treat these phenomena along parallel tracks; with one literature on presidential crises and another on judicial politics.

However, a prior question that must have occurred to the reader is whether it is normatively desirable for the IMF to exercise influence, and I turn to this question before proceeding with my argument. Critics of unbridled capital markets and the ""Washington Consensus"" that supports them worry that international institutions and global capital flows may so constrain economic policies during the transition that weak democratic institutions are swept away by popular discontent. Furthermore, they argue, the IMF's neoliberal economic prescriptions of tight monetary and fiscal policies, deregulating the economy, and lowering the barriers to the ""creative destruction"" wreaked by markets—stabilization, liberalization, and privatization—represent a naïve application of standardized recipes to a much more complex reality. In the felicitous Russian aphorism, it is easy to turn an aquarium into fish soup, but only God can reconstitute the aquarium. To the contrary, I argue that the basic thrust of the policies urged by the international financial institutions was, in fact, correct. At this point, I want to distinguish carefully between the basic strategy of transition and the specific tactical choices that were made in particular countries. By tactical choices I mean operational decisions on which economic theory does not yet provide straightforward guidance, such as the best ways of targeting exchange rates, the ideal method of privatization, and the optimal sequence of structural reforms. The Fund supported programs in countries that chose a wide range of approaches to these issues, but in some cases IMF staff promoted specific policies that turned out very poorly. We have learned things about economic transitions over the last ten years that would have made it possible to make better choices, had we known them earlier. On the other hand, the key IMF strategy for reform was clear: Accelerate the full spectrum of m arket reforms as much as possible, and lead with rapid macroeconomic stabilization and liberalization.

Today, strident party competition and partisan polarization are blamed for many of the ills of national and state politics. But a much deeper political science tradition points to the virtues of competitive party politics. In this historical analysis, we find that states with competitive party systems spend more than other states—and specifically spend more on education, health, and transportation, areas identified as investments in human capital and infrastructure. We find that this spending leads to longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, better educational outcomes, and higher incomes. Thus we conclude that party competition is not just healthy for a political system but for the life prospects of a state’s residents.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/1HOKCH","the_review","c(""Parties"", ""State Politics"", ""State Spending"", ""Education"", ""Literacy"", ""Life Expectancy"", ""Infant Mortality"", ""Income"")","1","0","Replication Data for: Life, Literacy, and the Pursuit of Prosperity: Party Competition and Policy Outcomes in 50 States","American Political Science Review Dataverse","2021-08-02T12:20:27Z","American Political Science Review Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/1HOKCH","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-08-02T12:20:27Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/1HOKCH","247929","RELEASED"

Financial conditionality has weak effects on investment decisions by non-US firms, which implies a political-economy interpretation. Firm-level data indicate that the distinctive behavior of US firms is not due to advantages of scale or to a US-firm fixed effect, but to US influence in the IMF.

We reject a test of model fit in only 5 of those systems, while a simpler model without thresholds is rejected in favor of our estimated model in 49 electoral systems. We find that the two modal electoral system configurations involve higher thresholds with seat allocation for parties exceeding thresholds that does not statistically differ from perfectly proportional allocation (32.76\% of all systems); and systems for which we cannot reject the absence of a national threshold but exhibit disproportional seat allocation for parties eligible for seats (38.79% of all systems).

Less well-known is the tumult that soaring migration is creating in the politics of developing countries. The key difference between anti-migrant politics in developed and developing countries is that domestic migration - not international migration - is the likely focus of nativist politics in poorer countries. Nativists take up the cause of sub-national groups, vilifying other regions and groups within the country as sources of migration. Since the 1970s, the majority of less-developed countries have adopted policies that aim to limit internal migration. This Element marshals evidence from around the world to explore the colliding trends of internal migration and nativism. Subnational migration is associated with a boom in nativist politics. Pro-native public policy and anti-migrant riots are both more likely when internal migration surges.

This tradeoff provides a previously unrecognized rationale for coalition formation in elections. We take our model to data from Mexican municipal elections between 1995-2016 and show that coalitions between parties on opposite ends of the ideology spectrum have served as an instrument of democratic consolidation.","163","doi:10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","ajps","c(""Electoral coalitions"", ""Entrenched incumbency"", ""Dynamic electoral competition"", ""Regression discontinuity design"", ""Structural estimation"")","1","1","Replication Data for: Sleeping with the Enemy: Effective Representation Under Dynamic Electoral Competition","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","2021-10-08T13:58:46Z","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","Social Sciences","dataset","2021-10-08T14:03:47Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LFLCMA","274944","RELEASED"

This article explains how parties strategically allocate these benefits when trading off the income effect relative to the standard electoral rewards of redistribution. The theory highlights a previously unstudied rationale to target opposition areas: to weaken voters’ dependence on machines. The framework is tested with administrative data on the allocation of cisterns by state governments across Brazilian semi-arid municipalities, where clientelism is rampant. States favor areas governed by copartisans, but only where local clientelistic mobilization is weak.

We identify five main sources of systemic instability and develop measures of each of them, demonstrating that the majority of territorial claims in Europe are drawn at times when regional great powers are embroiled in crisis, e.g., 1848 or 1870 during the 19th century. Importantly, the claims that emerge at these times are not necessarily among states involved in the crises that generated turmoil in the system, e.g., Prussia and France in 1870. Moreover, we use a newly developed spatial measure of historical boundary precedents in Europe from 1650-1790 to demonstrate that the effect of this known spatial correlate of where claims are drawn only matters when the European system is in crisis. We further demonstrate that this pattern of claim-timing is general to the global system of states.

Most notably, our results suggest that strategic incumbents can receive money early in the campaign if they desire but that they are generally unwilling to pay the price of lower aggregate fundraising and greater provision of access. These findings buttress earlier empirical findings that question the instrumental value of early money. In addition, our results highlight that contribution choices are fundamentally influenced by short-term factors, especially electoral conditions, that do not lend themselves to the routinized behavior necessary for contributors to invest in incumbents for long-run payoffs.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/3LOTUL","pan","NULL","1","0","Replication data for: The Time to Give: PAC Motivations and Electoral Timing","Political Analysis Dataverse","2010-02-16T00:00:00Z","Political Analysis Dataverse","s3://1902.1/13971","list()","dataset","2015-04-11T06:53:25Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/3LOTUL","44038","RELEASED"

We are pleased that dGG's analyses are consistent with the theoretical conjecture about international conflict put forward in BKZ --- ""The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large stable and replicable whenever the ex ante probability of conflict is large"" (BKZ, p.21) --- and that dGG agree with our main methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting performance should always be one of the standards used to judge s tudies of international conflict, and indeed most other areas of political science. However, dGG frequently err when they draw methodological conclusions. Their central claim involves the superiority of logit over neural network models for international conflict data, as judged by forecasting performance and other properties such as ease of use and interpretation (""neural networks hold few unambiguous advantages... and carry significant costs"" relative to logit; dGG, p.14). We show here that this claim, which would be regarded as stunning in any of the diverse f ields in which both methods are more commonly used, is false. We also show that dGG's methodological errors and the restrictive model they favor cause them to miss and mischaracterize crucial patterns in the causes of international conflict. We begin in the next section by summarizing the growing support for our conjecture about international conflict. The second section discusses the theoretical reasons why neural networks dominate logistic regression, correcting a number of methodological errors. The third section then demonstrates empirically, in the same data as used in BKZ and dGG, that neural networks substantially outperform dGG's logit model. We show that neural networks improve on the forecasts from logit as much as logit improves on a model with no theoretical variables. We also show how dGG's logit analysis assumed, rather than estimated, the answer to the central question about the literature's most important finding, the effect of democracy on war. Since this and other substantive assumptions underlying their logit model are wrong, their substantive conclusion about the democratic peace is also wrong. The neural network models we used in BKZ not only avoid these difficulties, but they, or one of the other methods available that do not make highly restrictive assumptions about the exact functional form, are just what is called for to study the observable implications of our conjecture.

To show this, we characterize the preference aggregation rule implied by the AMCE and demonstrate its several undesirable properties. With this result we provide a method for placing bounds on the proportion of experimental subjects who prefer a given candidate-feature. We describe conditions under which the AMCE corresponds in sign with the majority preference. Finally, we offer a structural interpretation of the AMCE and highlight that the problem we describe persists even when a model of voting is imposed.","16","doi:10.7910/DVN/DR0YF2","ajps","c(""Conjoint experiments"", ""Social choice theory"", ""Survey methodology"", ""Preference aggregation"", ""Electoral politics"")","1","1","Replication Data for: What Do We Learn About Voter Preferences from Conjoint Experiments?","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","2022-03-22T13:56:18Z","American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/DR0YF2","Social Sciences","dataset","2023-04-26T14:29:58Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DR0YF2","344098","RELEASED"

But did outcomes improve after colonial rule ended? Studying post–World War II independence cases, we statistically examine consequences of postwar decolonization—which includes both colonial autonomy and independence—for democracy, internal conflict, government revenue growth, and economic growth using two-way fixed-effects models. We find that democracy levels increased sharply as colonies gained internal autonomy in the period immediately before their independence. However, conflict, revenue growth, and economic growth did not systematically differ before and after independence. Accounting for varieties of colonial institutions or for endogenous independence timing produces similar results. Except for democratic gains, the overall findings—juxtaposed with existing research—suggest that, although European colonial empires created deleterious long-term effects, decolonization exhibited less pronounced political consequences than sometimes thought.","8","doi:10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","isq","Decolonization, Economic Development, Political Development,","1","0","Replication Data for: What Were the Consequences of Decolonization?","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","2020-01-13T14:50:08Z","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","Social Sciences","dataset","2020-01-13T14:50:08Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVSLO2","179721","RELEASED"

Yet recently, these parties have elected more women. Under what conditions do we see this increase in women MPs? This paper presents a novel argument of strategic descriptive representation: electorally struggling RRP parties with large gender gaps in voter support increase their proportion of women MPs to attract previously untapped women voters. To test this argument, we develop the most comprehensive dataset to date on women MPs and gender differences in voter support across Europe and over time, covering 187 parties in 30 countries from 1985 to 2018. Our analyses confirm that RRP parties engage in strategic descriptive representation when they are both struggling electorally and suffering from a gender gap in support. Additional models reveal that this tactic is largely unique to RRP parties.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/SG55BJ","the_review","gender and politics, representation, political parties, gender gap, strategic descriptive representation, radical right populist parties","1","0","Replication Data for: When do Männerparteien Elect Women?

We find that voters draw different inferences when they see reneging by different actors, and only Left governments are punished for breaking their promises. We test this hypothesis in the context of the post-Communist countries from 1990 to 2007 and find that Left governments were more likely to fall if they reneged on exchange rate commitments, but Right governments were not.","3","doi:10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","isq","NULL","1","0","Risky Signals: The Political Costs of Exchange Rate Policy in Post-Communist Countries","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","2018-07-05T19:07:30Z","International Studies Quarterly Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","Social Sciences","dataset","2018-07-05T19:07:30Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DYKHRO","138437","RELEASED"

However, this theory breaks down in magnetized, turbulent, weakly colli- sional plasmas, although modifications are difficult to predict from first principles due to the complex, multiscale nature of the problem. Understanding heat transport is important in astrophysical plasmas such as those in gal- axy clusters, where observed temperature profiles are explicable only in the presence of a strong suppression of heat conduction compared to Spitzer’s theory. To address this problem, we have created a replica of such a sys- tem in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a reduction of heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading to large temperature variations on small spatial scales (as is seen in cluster plasmas).","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","MIT-PSFC","c(""heat flux densities"", ""heat transport"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetized plasma"", ""plasma physics"")","1","0","Strong suppression of heat conduction in a laboratory replica of galaxy-cluster turbulent plasmas","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-11-03T13:18:04Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","Physics","dataset","2022-11-03T13:18:04Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYWNMB","328322","RELEASED"

Sociodemographic information obtained at baseline included age, sex, education level, marital status, living condition, employment status, religion and economic satisfaction. Our primary outcome variables were depression symptom severity, and HTN control. The measure of depressive symptom change was a valid and reliable Chinese translation of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS). Items for analysis included response to treatment, defined as a ≥50% change in the HDRS score from baseline, and remission of depression defined as a total HDRS score <10 at follow-up. BP was measured at baseline and each follow-up point according to standards developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The primary variable for analysis was dichotomous – controlled vs. uncontrolled HTN. Consistent with the Hypertension Treatment Guidelines, uncontrolled HTN was defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 or diastolic BP ≥ 80 for patients with diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease or renal disease, and BP ≥ 140 or diastolic BP≥90 for all others. Variables known to influence response to treatment of depression or HTN were included as covariates: the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is associated with hypertension treatment response, and the WHOQOL-BREF for quality of life, which is a widely used measure and the Chinese version of which has shown very good psychometric properties. As a measure of functioning independent of the WHOQOL-BREF physical domain score, we assessed the subject’s impairment in basic (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

In this article, we develop a novel experimental design that focuses on whether concrete knowledge about other voters' political knowledge influences political participation.

It documents the life of Monica, an American woman born with congenital atrasia of the esophagus who was fed by a gastric fistula until 2 years of age when corrective surgery was performed. The project began in October of 1953 when Drs. Franz Reichsman and George Engel met Monica, age 15 months, while she was hospitalized for retarded growth and development, depression and malnutrition. What began then as a limited case study of depression in an infant with a gastric fistula expanded into an intensive, multimethod, multimedia, longitudinal exploration of her life. After filming and testing Monica during this nine month hospital stay, the research team continued to follow her development after reconstructive surgery of the esophagus at age two, into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Monica married at age 19 and bore four daughters over the next seven years. Data collection of Monica, her mother, siblings, husband and four children, continued until Murray Center acquisition of the data in 1995. Investigators anticipate continued contact with Monica and her family in the future. The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (11 hours of silent film (transferred to video) dating from 1953 to 1976; 40 hours of video, dating from 1972 to 1994; 232 interviews (with Monica and family members); 252 psychological tests (including projective, personality, and intelligence tests of Monica and family); 464 notes from observation of laboratory testing sessions, 39 notes from phone conversations; 148 transcripts of laboratory sessions; 57 pieces of artwork (by Monica, her siblings, and her children); 36 items of correspondence; 30 experiments; 56 medical notes; 6 newspaper articles; 145 other notes and items; 1586 photographs; and 248 audiotapes of laboratory sessions).

A theoretical framework attributing the origin and sustainment of these fields to the so-called fluctuation dynamo was recently validated by experiments on laser facilities in low-magnetic-Prandtl-number plasmas (Pm<1). However, the same framework proposes that the fluctuation dynamo should operate differently when Pm≳1, the regime relevant to many astrophysical environments such as the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. This paper reports an experiment that creates a laboratory Pm≳1 plasma dynamo. We provide a time-resolved characterization of the plasma’s evolution, measuring temperatures, densities, flow velocities, and magnetic fields, which allows us to explore various stages of the fluctuation dynamo’s operation on seed magnetic fields generated by the action of the Biermann-battery mechanism during the initial drive-laser target interaction. The magnetic energy in structures with characteristic scales close to the driving scale of the stochastic motions is found to increase by almost three orders of magnitude and saturate dynamically. It is shown that the initial growth of these fields occurs at a much greater rate than the turnover rate of the driving-scale stochastic motions. Our results point to the possibility that plasma turbulence produced by strong shear can generate fields more efficiently at the driving scale than anticipated by idealized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the nonhelical fluctuation dynamo; this finding could help explain the large-scale fields inferred from observations of astrophysical systems.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","MIT-PSFC","c(""fluctuation duo"", ""fluctuation dynamo"", ""laboratory astrophysics"", ""magnetic fields"", ""MHD"", ""turbulent plasmas"")","1","0","Time-resolved turbulent dynamo in a laser plasma","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","Physics","dataset","2022-03-16T13:21:31Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/USBOGQ","283704","RELEASED"

When scaled to National Ignition Facility laser energies of 1.9 MJ, these targets are predicted to produce a fusion energy output of ~500 kJ—several times larger than current fusion yields achieved at that facility. Future applications of this approach will guide the exploration of the vast parameter space for the conditions required for thermonuclear ignition and expose gaps in our understanding of laser-fusion physics.","1","doi:10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","MIT-PSFC","c(""direct drive"", ""inertial confinement fusion"", ""machine learning"", ""omega laser laboratory for laser energetics"", ""radiation hydrodynamics"")","1","0","Tripled yield in direct-drive laser fusion through statistical modelling","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","2019-03-11T17:27:35Z","Plasma Science and Fusion Center Dataverse","s3://10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","Physics","dataset","2019-03-11T17:27:35Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RHN8RC","151033","RELEASED"

To address these concerns, we provide original data from surveys of political science experts and the public measuring the perceived importance and performance of U.S. democracy on a number of dimensions during the first year and a half of the Trump presidency. We draw on a theory of how politicians may transgress limits on their authority and the conditions under which constraints are self-enforcing. We connect this theory to our survey data in an effort to identify potential areas of agreement – bright lines – among experts and the public about the most important democratic principles and whether they have been violated. Public and expert perceptions often differ on the importance of specific democratic principles. In addition, though our experts perceive substantial democratic erosion, particularly in areas related to checks and balances, polarization between Trump supporters and opponents undermines any social consensus recognizing these violations.","15","doi:10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","perspectives","Democracy, democratic erosion, Trump","1","0","Vol. 17(3)- Replication Data for: Searching for Bright Lines in the Trump Presidency","Perspectives on Politics","2019-03-08T13:07:41Z","Perspectives on Politics","s3://10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","Social Sciences","dataset","2019-03-08T13:07:41Z","https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IYWXMF","149274","RELEASED"

This data collection combines all four waves of youth data for the study. The general objective of the data collection was to study the dynamics of political attitudes and behaviors by obtaining data on the same individuals as they aged from approximately 18 years of age in 1965 to 50 years of age in 1997. Especially when combined with other elements of the study as released in other ICPSR collections in the Youth Studies Series, this data collection facilitates the analysis of generational, life cycle, and historical effects and political influences on relationships within the family. This data collection also has several distinctive properties. First, it is a longitudinal study of a particular cohort, a national sample from the graduating high school class of 1965. Second, it captures the respondents at key points in their life stages -- at ages 18, 26, 35, and 50. Third, the dataset contains many replicated measures over time as well as some measures unique to each data point. Fourth, there is detailed information about the respondents' life histories.
