The morphology of a large well-preserved humerus supports identification of a new volant, possibly diving, ornithurine species (Tingmiatornis arctica). The new bird fossils are part of a freshwater vertebrate fossil assemblage that documents a period of extreme climatic warmth without seasonal ice, with minimum mean annual temperatures of 14°C. The extreme warmth allowed species expansion and establishment of an ecosystem more easily able to support large birds, especially in fresh water bodies such as those present in the Turonian High Arctic. Review of the high latitude distribution of Northern Hemisphere Mesozoic birds shows only ornithurine birds are known to have occupied these regions. We propose physiological differences in ornithurines such as growth rate may explain their latitudinal distribution especially as temperatures decline later in the Cretaceous. Distribution and physiology merit consideration as factors in their preferential survival of parts of one ornithurine lineage, Aves, through the K/Pg boundary.  Digital files of an open access manuscript and supplemental materials file and digital copies of figures that went into the manuscript are included with this data set upload. Samples were collected during field seasons on Axel Heiberg Island. Cat scan imagery was conducted at the University of Texas, Austin.

These measurements were used to help constrain the source of methane to these waters, and by extension, the atmosphere.  These seawater samples were prepared and analyzed for the dissolved concentration of methane [CH4], the stable carbon isotopes of methane (δ13C-CH4), and the natural radiocarbon content of methane (14C-CH4).  New techniques were used to prepare the samples for the stable and radiocarbon isotopes of methane (Sparrow and Kessler, Limnology & Oceanography: Methods, 2017) and previously published techniques were used to determine dissolved methane concentration (Weinstein et al., Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 2016).  The 14C-CH4 content and conventional 14C age uncertainty incorporates the collection, preparation, and measurement uncertainties.   The δ13C-CH4 uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty associated with isotope ratio mass spectrometer or the cavity-ringdown spectrometer.  The [CH4] uncertainty is 5.2% of the measurement.","Arctic Ocean,Methane,Earth Science,Oceans,Ocean Chemistry,Radiocarbon,Stable Isotopes","Beaufort Sea methane data, 2015","John Kessler","University of Rochester",NA
