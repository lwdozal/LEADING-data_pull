In parallel, the LAT team has undertaken a coherent long-term effort aimed at a radical revision of the entire event-level analysis, based on the experience gained in the prime phase of the mission. This includes virtually every aspect of the data reduction process, from the simulation of the detector to the event reconstruction and the background rejection. The potential improvements include (but are not limited to) a significant reduction in background contamination coupled with an increased effective area, a better point-spread function, a better understanding of the systematic uncertainties and an extension of the energy reach for the photon analysis below 100 MeV and above a few hundred GeV.

Although it is not yet finalized, we can test the improvements in the new event reconstruction with the special case of the prompt phase of bright Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), where the signal to noise ratio is large enough that loose selection cuts are sufficient to identify gamma- rays associated with the source. Using the new event reconstruction, we have re-analyzed ten GRBs previously detected by the LAT for which an x-ray/optical follow-up was possible and found four new gamma rays with energies greater than 10 GeV in addition to the seven previously known. Among these four is a 27.4 GeV gamma-ray from GRB 080916C, which has a redshift of 4.35, thus making it the gamma ray with the highest intrinsic energy (147 GeV) detected from a GRB. We present here the salient aspects of the new event reconstruction and discuss the scientific implications of these new high-energy gamma rays, such as constraining extragalactic background light models, Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) tests, the prompt emission mechanism and the bulk Lorentz factor of the emitting region."",

The conventional measurement probabilities derived from squares of the wavefunction then describes the effects of measurement back-action, which originate from a non-classical relation between dynamics and statistics that is characteristic of quantum mechanics. It is pointed out that this relation can be used to derive the complete Hilbert space formalism directly from complex probabilities, without the axiomatic introduction of quantum states or operators."",

The random variable will \""concentrate\"" around its median or expectation. In this work, we explore several theories and applications of concentration of measure. The results of the thesis are divided into three main parts. In the first part, we explore concentration of measure for several random operator compressions and for the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random walk evolving under the asymmetric exclusion process, by generalizing an approach of Chatterjee and Ledoux. In the second part, we consider the mixed matrix moments of the complex Ginibre ensemble and relate them to the expected overlap functions of the eigenvectors as introduced by Chalker and Mehlig. In the third part, we develop a $q$-Stirling's formula and discuss a method for simulating a random permutation distributed according to the Mallows measure. We then apply the $q$-Stirling's formula to obtain asymptotics for a four square decomposition of points distributed in a square according to the Mallows measure. All of the results in the third part are preliminary steps toward bounding the fluctuations of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a Mallows permutation."",

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not use correct words or positive examples to follow, but presents the child a misspelled word as an exercise to solve. We created these training exercises on the basis of the linguistic knowledge extracted from the errors found in texts written by children with dyslexia. To test the effectiveness of this method in Spanish, we integrated the exercises in a game for iPad, DysEggxia (Piruletras in Spanish), and carried out a within-subject experiment. During eight weeks, 48 children played either DysEggxia or Word Search, which is another word game. We conducted tests and questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after four weeks when the games were switched, and at the end of the study. The children who played DysEggxia for four weeks in a row had significantly less writing errors in the tests that after playing Word Search for the same time. This provides evidence that error-based exercises presented in a tablet help children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills."",

The classical Fuglede conjecture in locally compact abelian groups says that a set is spectral if and only if it tiles by translation. This conjecture was disproved by T. Tao in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 5 and higher, using constructions over prime fields (in vector spaces over finite fields of prime order) and lifting them to the Euclidean setting. Over prime fields, when the dimension of the vector space is less than or equal to $2$ it has recently been proven that the Fuglede conjecture holds (see \\cite{IMP15}). In this paper we study this question in higher dimensions over prime fields and provide some results and counterexamples. In particular we prove the existence of spectral sets which do not tile in $\\mathbb{Z}_p^5$ for all odd primes $p$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_p^4$ for all odd primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 3 \\text{ mod } 4$. Although counterexamples in low dimensional groups over cyclic rings $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ were previously known they were usually for non prime $n$ or a small, sporadic set of primes $p$ rather than general constructions.

Within <i>Acanthosmioides</i>, females of <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i> are most similar to <i>O</i>. <i>unca</i> Michener, but can be distinguished from that species by the relatively strong third tooth of the mandible (forming distinctly pointed tooth on margin nearest second tooth) (Fig. 23) and by the white hairs of the mesepisternum (<i>O</i>. <i>unca</i> has dark hairs on the mesepisternum in the portion of its range that overlaps <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i>, and paler hairs in more northern locations). <i>Osmia palmula</i> is known from other female <i>Acanthosmioides</i> by the following combination of characters: 1. Vertex, mesoscutum, scutellum, and T 1 with white hairs (black hairs sometimes interspersed on vertex and mesoscutum); 2. Vertex lacking distinct depression posterior to lateral ocelli (or if with slight depression then this depression only immediately posterior to ocelli); 3. Gena in lateral view with ventral and dorsal margins rounded away from each other (hypostomal area convex); 4. Propodeal triangle with lower, lateral or entire half to third glabrous, strongly shining (Fig. 24); 5. Metasomal terga with wide impunctate bands at the apical margins (Fig. 25). Males are readily distinguished by the enlarged, flattened F 11, the apical tip of which is black (strongly contrasting with remainder of antenna, which is orange) and shining on the posterior surface (when antenna is directed upwards) (Figs. 27–29). The only other <i>Osmia</i> species with the combination of this type of antenna and no process on S 2 is <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i> Cockerell; <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i> can be distinguished from <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i> by the following two characters: 1. S 4 midapically has a dense patch of coarse, orange-brown hairs plus an additional fringe of medially uninterrupted stout orange-brown hairs along the apical margin (Fig. 34) (in <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i>, the midapical patch of hairs on S 4 is dark brown, and S 4 lacks a medially uninterrupted fringe of hairs along the apical margin), 2.

Within <i>Acanthosmioides</i>, females of <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i> are most similar to <i>O</i>. <i>unca</i> Michener, but can be distinguished from that species by the relatively strong third tooth of the mandible (forming distinctly pointed tooth on margin nearest second tooth) (Fig. 23) and by the white hairs of the mesepisternum (<i>O</i>. <i>unca</i> has dark hairs on the mesepisternum in the portion of its range that overlaps <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i>, and paler hairs in more northern locations). <i>Osmia palmula</i> is known from other female <i>Acanthosmioides</i> by the following combination of characters: 1. Vertex, mesoscutum, scutellum, and T 1 with white hairs (black hairs sometimes interspersed on vertex and mesoscutum); 2. Vertex lacking distinct depression posterior to lateral ocelli (or if with slight depression then this depression only immediately posterior to ocelli); 3. Gena in lateral view with ventral and dorsal margins rounded away from each other (hypostomal area convex); 4. Propodeal triangle with lower, lateral or entire half to third glabrous, strongly shining (Fig. 24); 5. Metasomal terga with wide impunctate bands at the apical margins (Fig. 25). Males are readily distinguished by the enlarged, flattened F 11, the apical tip of which is black (strongly contrasting with remainder of antenna, which is orange) and shining on the posterior surface (when antenna is directed upwards) (Figs. 27–29). The only other <i>Osmia</i> species with the combination of this type of antenna and no process on S 2 is <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i> Cockerell; <i>O</i>. <i>palmula</i> can be distinguished from <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i> by the following two characters: 1. S 4 midapically has a dense patch of coarse, orange-brown hairs plus an additional fringe of medially uninterrupted stout orange-brown hairs along the apical margin (Fig. 34) (in <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i>, the midapical patch of hairs on S 4 is dark brown, and S 4 lacks a medially uninterrupted fringe of hairs along the apical margin), 2. The gonoforceps has a distal process that is nearly three times as long as apical width (Figs. 35, 38, 39) (only two times as long as apical width in <i>O</i>. <i>watsoni</i>). <b>Description.—Female</b>.

Unfortunately, we have been unable to locate any mountains by this name. It is possible that the recorded locality refers to mountains surrounding the city of Santa Fe; however, this would be a rather large range extension compared to the known distribution of this species. We have two additional male specimens that appear to be very similar morphologically to <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i> collected from Sierra Laguna in Baja California Sur in mid-October to mid-December. However, the incongruent flight times and novel ecoregion represented by this locality, as well as lack of female material from this region, make us hesitant to include these specimens among the material represented in the redescription of <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i>. We tentatively consider these two specimens as a different species closely related to <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i> and defer the description of them until we have further material."",

Unfortunately, we have been unable to locate any mountains by this name. It is possible that the recorded locality refers to mountains surrounding the city of Santa Fe; however, this would be a rather large range extension compared to the known distribution of this species. We have two additional male specimens that appear to be very similar morphologically to <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i> collected from Sierra Laguna in Baja California Sur in mid-October to mid-December. However, the incongruent flight times and novel ecoregion represented by this locality, as well as lack of female material from this region, make us hesitant to include these specimens among the material represented in the redescription of <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i>. We tentatively consider these two specimens as a different species closely related to <i>O</i>. <i>foxi</i> and defer the description of them until we have further material."",

Cool, fast groundwater-fed creek entering into Little Long Lake. On private property, with a well-developed riparian zone: organic material in slower pools in the bend of the creek, where coarse sand and decaying hardwoods have accumulated (08/06/ 2009). <b>Other localities in the Nearctic.</b> Charlevoix? (Michigan, USA) (Woodworth 1896; Stringer 1951; see remark Table 1); Rochester (New York, USA) (Graff 1911); Kapsigdlit (Greenland) (Reisinger &amp; Steinböck 1927); upper Mississippi Basin (Wisconsin and possibly other states, USA) (Higley 1918; Hayes 1942; Watermolen 2005). <b>Material.</b> One whole mount containing the stylets of two individuals and the bundle of spermatophores of probably one individual. This material was recovered from specimens kindly provided by Christopher Laumer (Harvard University, USA), but animals were unfortunately decaying when received at Hasselt University (Belgium). It appeared that one stylet belonged to an individual eaten by another, cannibalistic specimen. Other observations were impossible because of the advanced state of decomposition of the animals. <b>Description and remarks.</b> Although observations on live animals were impossible, the whole mount allows a relatively detailed study of the stylet morphology. The stylet is 135 µm long and consists of a proximal, 20 µmhigh, half open girdle (<i>gi</i>) and a distal, 115 µm-long tube (<i>tu</i>) surrounded by a partly-open, funnel-shaped sheath (<i>sh</i>) and flanked by a number of heteromorphic spines on both sides (Figs. 6 D–F). The girdle has a concave proximal edge and appears fibrous and reticulate. Proximally, the sheath is relatively broad and contains a large open window. At about halfway along its length, it becomes more narrow and closes around the tube. Distally, the sheath and inner tube tightly fit, but their relative positions become very difficult to discern. At one lateral side of the girdle, a somewhat broadened plate (<i>bp</i>) bearing two smaller, straight spines (20 µm) is present. On the other side, the girdle edge bears a long, somewhat curved spine (50 µm), accompanied by a large, hollow, S-shaped spine (<i>ss</i>) (60 µm) with a very broad, open base. Luther (1955) rightly compares its shape with that of a drinking horn (“Trinkhorn”). In one of the whole mounts, its distal point is somewhat broadened to form a small triangular plate (arrow in Fig. 6 D). In between both lateral spine duos and the central sheathed tube, a long, straight spine (<i>s</i>) (55 µm) flanking the sheath on each side, complete the stylet. Apart from the stylet, about thirteen, slender spermatophores (up to 300 µm long) could be discerned in the whole mount. They are elongated with one end tapering to a pointed tip and the other end being curled. Luther (1955) even described them as nematode-shaped (“nematodenförmig”). Although some might have changed position when making the whole mount, most of them seem to have been organized in a relatively solid, spirally-curled bundle. Although reported as very abundant in its type locality by Graff (1911) and considered to be widespread by Higley (1918), <i>Gieysztoria dodgei</i> (Graff, 1911) Ruebush &amp; Hayes, 1939 is a poorly-known species. All confirmed findings are located around the Great Lakes, except for the locality in Greenland (see above). Based on sketches of the habitus and copulatory organ by Woodworth (1986) and Stringer (1918), Luther (1955) stated that <i>Vortex bilineata</i> Woodworth, 1886 [later renamed <i>Dalyellia bilineata</i> (Woodworth, 1886) Stringer, 1918], also from Michigan, might probably also be attributed to <i>G. dodgei</i>. Luther’s (1955) descripition of the stylet based on the accounts of Graff (1911, 1913), does not completely correspond with our observations. While the conspicuous, horn-shaped spine is identical as in the specimens studied in this paper, all previous authors describe the central tube and its sheath as two extremely long spines flanked by other spines of various sizes. In our opinion, the central tube and its sheath have a similar construction to that of <i>Gieysztoria infundibuliformis</i> (Fuhrmann, 1894) Ruebush &amp; Hayes, 1939, i.e. a long, funnel-shaped double-walled tube (“Rinne”) with a very large proximal window (“Fenster”) in the outer wall (sheath). The inner tube (“Rohr”) is probably formed by the fusion of the superimposed sidewalls of the whole structure (for a detailed description, see Luther 1955). Although this sheathed tube is also flanked by long straight spines, <i>G. infundibuliformis</i> lacks a large, horn-shaped spine as in <i>G. dodgei</i>. Instead, multispinous axes (“Endäste”) are present on both outer girdle edges. The stylet construction of another species, <i>Gieysztoria koiwi</i> (Eggers, 1925) Luther, 1955, is very similar, but more simple with two central plates (“Rinne”) proximally, fusing to a tube (“Rohr”) distally. Both <i>G. infundibuliformis</i> and <i>G. k o i w i</i> are confined to the Palearctic. Based on stylet morphology, it seems that <i>G. dodgei</i>, <i>G. infundibuliformis</i> and <i>G. k o i w i</i> are closely related representatives of a Holarctic group."",

The morphology of the female genitalia is, however, clear. The syntype series of <i>S. vestita</i> consists of three female specimens from Sydney (ZMHB MG 3491), all specimens of <i>S. incana,</i> and a further specimen from Peak Downs (ZMH, MG 16537, BJR 1183) of a second species, <i>S. narraweena</i>. Accordingly, we designate a female specimen from Sydney (ZMHB MG 3491 A) as the lectotype of <i>Servaea vestita</i> (L. Koch, 1879) and the remaining two Sydney specimens as paralectotypes, so as to stabilise usage of the names. The type of <i>P. validus</i> Urquhart 1893 could not be found and the description is insufficient to diagnose the species, however all known specimens of <i>Servaea</i> from Tasmania are of <i>S. incana</i> (as <i>S. vestita</i>) and so it is considered a junior synonym of <i>S. incana</i>. <b>Type material.

The morphology of the female genitalia is, however, clear. The syntype series of <i>S. vestita</i> consists of three female specimens from Sydney (ZMHB MG 3491), all specimens of <i>S. incana,</i> and a further specimen from Peak Downs (ZMH, MG 16537, BJR 1183) of a second species, <i>S. narraweena</i>. Accordingly, we designate a female specimen from Sydney (ZMHB MG 3491 A) as the lectotype of <i>Servaea vestita</i> (L. Koch, 1879) and the remaining two Sydney specimens as paralectotypes, so as to stabilise usage of the names. The type of <i>P. validus</i> Urquhart 1893 could not be found and the description is insufficient to diagnose the species, however all known specimens of <i>Servaea</i> from Tasmania are of <i>S. incana</i> (as <i>S. vestita</i>) and so it is considered a junior synonym of <i>S. incana</i>. <b>Type material.

Instead of applying circularly polarized cw light, as in conventional optical pumping, we propose to use techniques for coherent population transfer (e.g., adiabatic fast passage) to arrange the atoms so as to increase the entropy removed from the system with each spontaneous decay from the upper state. This minimizes the number of spontaneous-emission events required to produce a stretched state, thus reducing the population loss due to decay to other states. To produce a stretched state in a manifold with angular momentum J, conventional optical pumping requires about 2J spontaneous decays per atom, one of our proposed methods reduces this to about log_2(2J), while another of the methods reduces it to about one spontaneous decay, independent of J."",

We use the Greater New York City area as a representative for large cities, and the Greater Rochester area as a representative for smaller cities in the United States. We employed matrix factor analysis as an unsupervised method to extract salient mobility and work-rest patterns for a large population of users within each metropolitan area. We discovered interesting human behavior patterns at both a larger scale and a finer granularity than is present in previous literature, some of which allow us to quantitatively compare the behaviors of individuals of living in big cities to those living in small cities.

The required sensors leverage the space flight heritage and further development over the last 15 years of HgCdTe detectors to detect infrared light spanning from 4 to 10 μm . NEO Surveyor will employ eight passively cooled HgCdTe focal plane assemblies (FPAs) across two bands, each band consisting of a 1x4 configuration to cover a wide field of view. Four of these FPAs have a &gt; 6 μm cutoff wavelength and cover the shorter 4-5.2 μm (NC1) band, while four FPAs will have a &gt; 10.5 μm cutoff wavelength and span the longer 6-10 μm (NC2) band. We present characterization and performance results from two recently produced pathfinder FPAs, one for each band, manufactured by Teledyne Imaging Sensors with development guidance from the University of Arizona, the University of Rochester, IPAC/Caltech, and JPL. Both devices demonstrate the requisite low levels of dark current, high well depth, and exceptional quantum efficiency, exceeding mission requirements."",

Laties encountered pharmacology before engaging with the science of behavior. Interrupting undergraduate work at Tufts for service in the navy, he became a pharmacist's mate during the 1940s.

Then, while Vic was teaching at Brown, Ogden Lindsley demonstrated the power of operant contingencies to him at a chance meeting. Vic later moved to Johns Hopkins and was soon joined by Bernie. Their collaborative work in pharmacology and behavior continued after both returned to the University of Rochester. At the medical school Bernie expanded his research in behavioral toxicology as Vic devoted more of his time to editorial activities and to the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, eventually serving for more than half a century as Executive Editor of its journals. This account describes some of that service and some aspects of Vic's later years, during which he remained active in retirement as well as he could while he and his wife Marty coped with his progressive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Though his remembering gradually faded, he completed a memoir and continued a rich and memorable life with family and friends."",

This volume only includes recordings taken at 6 months of age. The recordings in this volume were analyzed for the Bergelson &amp; Aslin citation above, alongside eyetracking data. The broader project is described below: SEEDLingS is a project exploring how infants' early linguistic and environmental input plays a role in their learning. We focus on understanding how babies learn words between 6 and 18 months of age from the visual, social, and linguistic world around them. By looking at the complex environment that babies are exposed to, from their perspective, we can attempt to decode how the developing mind interprets and organizes the objects and words it faces. SEEDLingS is unique in that it combines well-controlled studies in the lab that assess what words infants know, with in-the-home audio and video recordings of what words infants hear, and what they see when they hear these words. Video and audio recordings were generated in the home every month, from 6 to 17 months of age, for a set of 44 infants. The goal of this study is to assess infants' language growth over this time period, particularly in the word learning domain. Every two months, infants came into the lab for an eye-tracking study to test their word comprehension (and for older infants, their word production). This volume includes the audio and video recordings from 6 month home visits. Corresponding test dates for each audio and video recording are included as a supplementary spreadsheet, which can be accessed in the materials folder of this volume. The day-long audio recordings were generated using child-perspective LENA recorders (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, United States) worn by the infant. The audio recordings are generated from one single LENA audio recording, converted from LENA's propriety algorithmic output (.its) for annotation in CHA format. The hour-long video recordings show a composite view of infants' typical lives with 1-4 camera feeds. In the standard setup, infants are equipped with 2 headcams, and a centralized camcorder that captures the entire room. The precise arrangement and number of cameras varies per video, as a function of whether the child would wear the hat with the cameras, and whether the cameras' files became corrupt during the recordings. Shared files have been scrubbed for certain personal information (e.g. full names, addresses, etc.); this leads to some silent periods on the audio track and some black-out periods on the video track. Only sections of the files that have been verified to contain no extremely personal content by human listeners (or from which such info has been scrubbed) are shared here. If you notice anything that you believe we may have missed in terms of personal information, please contact us as soon as possible so we can rectify the issue. Infants in this sample are from the upstate New York area. The sample is generally middle class, with a range of income and an above-average maternal education level. The sample is predominantly white. All infants heard majority English at home (&gt;75%) and had no known vision or hearing issues at birth. Please contact Elika Bergelson directly to discuss further aspects of the sample design, annotation, and analysis at elika.bergelson@gmail.com These data were collected at the University of Rochester, and continue to be analyzed presently at Duke University. Further details of the project are available on our website, wiki, and GitHub repo, linked below."",

Fortunately, disease is minimized by therapies that allow most infants to go home with seemingly healthy lungs. But as these individuals become adults, there is growing concern that they are developing PH and heart failure that will profoundly shorten their lifespan. PH in adults born preterm is an emerging epidemic of growing concern because conservative estimates suggest there are 4 million survivors of preterm birth living in<br>the U.S. with subclinical PH in 40% of these individuals. The risk of developing disease is highest in adults born extremely preterm and thus directly associated with their need for supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) as preterm infants. Our overall goal is to uncover novel mechanisms by which hyperoxia at birth causes PH in adults and test interventions that may prevent or treat disease. To achieve this goal, we have been studying a unique long-term follow up cohort of adult humans who were born preterm and an established mouse model wherein exposure to hyperoxia between postnatal days 0-4 causes PH and early mortality of adults via distinct stages. Since diastolic dysfunction and PH are present in our cohort of adult humans born preterm, we hypothesize neonatal hyperoxia causes end stage PH via dysregulation of Ang II-NOX3 signaling that was triggered by endothelial injury and promoted by impaired diastolic function. Primary animal studies conducted at the University of Rochester, and covered in a separate DMP. This DMP covers the translation to human studies conducted at UT Southwestern.

Neurophysiologically, violations of context-dependent predictions result in amplitude modulations of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) component. While N400 is widely used to measure semantic processing and integration, no publicly-available auditory stimulus set is available to standardize approaches across the field. Here, we developed an auditory stimulus set of 442 sentences that utilized the semantic anomaly paradigm, provided cloze probability for all stimuli, and was developed for both children and adults. With 20 neurotypical adults, we validated that this set elicits robust N400's, as well as two additional semantically-related ERP components: the recognition potential (~250 ms) and the late positivity component (~600 ms). This stimulus set (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9ghx3ffkg) and the 20 high-density (128-channel) electrophysiological datasets (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmx4) are made publicly available to promote data sharing and reuse.

""<strong>2.1 Participants</strong> Twenty-four neurotypical adults were recruited and provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Four subjects were excluded from data analysis due to failure to remain alert or to sit still during data collection (n=2), or due to noisy EEG data (n=2) (Figure S1). The remaining participants make up the fully-analyzed dataset. These twenty subjects ranged in age from 18 to 35 (mean age = 25.5 +/- 4.36), nine were female, and three were left-handed. Every participant spoke English as their first language, and twelve participants were mono-lingual while eight participants reported being bi- or multi- lingual. Demographic information for all participants, including those removed from further analysis are reported in Table 1. <strong>2.2 Stimuli</strong><strong> </strong> The semantic anomaly paradigm consisted of 221 sentence pairs with incongruent and congruent endings, for a total of 442 stimuli in this stimulus set. However, twenty sentence pairs were eliminated before analysis because their endings did not match in syllable number, contained hyphenated phrases, cultural references, or upon closer examination, the supposed incongruent endings were in fact congruent. The remaining 402 stimuli (201 congruent and 201 incongruent sentence pairs) ranged from four to eight words in length. Sentences were created using simple words, derived from a set of age-appropriate words contained in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic (MRCP) database (https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc.htm). For example, from the word \""cake\"", the congruent sentence \""He baked a birthday cake\"" was created. The words selected from the MRCP database took into consideration the age of acquisition (from a database provided by (Gilhooly and Logie, 1980)) and/or written word frequency (from a normed written word frequency set (Francis and Kucera, 1967)). This was to ensure that each sentence could be readily comprehended by NT individuals aged 5 years or older. The majority of these age-appropriate words were monosyllabic, but a few basic words with 2-syllables (e.g. present) and 3-syllables (e.g. animal) were included, due to their high-written-word frequency or early age of acquisition. Similar to previous studies using the MRCP database (Ross et al., 2011, 2007), we were sensitive to the fact that everyday language use has changed since the creation of these sets, so we carefully selected words that are still in common use. This stimulus set included sentence pairs where the incongruent endings were just semantic errors. After elimination, this amounts to 132 / 201 stimulus pairs including example stimuli. These incongruent endings were matched to their congruent pair in word type (e.g. noun or verb) and number (e.g. plural or singular). There were also sentence pairs where incongruent endings contained both semantic and syntactic errors. After elimination, this amounts to 69 / 201 stimulus pairs. Semantically incongruent endings were also classified as syntactic errors if the ending deviated from the syntax provided by the sentential context. The type of syntactic errors included: 1. Endings where a plural noun expectation was deviated with a singular noun or vice versa (27 stimulus pairs); 2. Endings where an adjective expectation was deviated with a noun or vice versa (20 stimulus pairs); and 3. Endings where a verb expectation was deviated with a noun or vice versa (22 stimulus pairs). During final analysis, these 3 types of syntactic errors were combined into a single linguistic division (LD) in order to compare the overall response to sentences with both semantic and syntactic errors, and the response to sentences with only semantic errors. Language comprehension in NT individuals is highly influenced by communicative cues such as prosody, especially when sentence meaning relies on syntactic prosodic cues (Thorson 2018, (Cutler et al., 1997; Dahan, 2015; Frazier et al., 2006, Thorson 2018). The intention of this manuscript was to create a stimulus set that could be used for all populations equally. Therefore, this stimulus set was constructed without prosody to ensure that NT individuals would not have an advantage in language comprehension over other populations known to have difficulty with communication or prosody, such as those with ASD (DePape et al., 2012; Eigsti et al., 2012; Martzoukou et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2007; O'Connor, 2012; Wang and Tsao, 2015) or schizophrenia (Leitman et al., 2007, 2005). To do so, individual words from the word list were recorded from a female speaker, instructed to voice the words with minimal inflection, stress, and intonation (i.e. in a monotonous non-prosodic manner). Words were then compiled into complete sentences using the Audacity Software (Version 3.0.0. Audacity® software is copyright © 1999 - 2021 Audacity Team. https://audacity team.org/ ). These artificially-compiled sentences were manually adjusted to have similar pitch-frequency between each word within a sentence and between all sentences. Concurrently, time gaps were added between words so that all sentences would have similar pacing and that researchers would be able to trigger discretely on each word. Both artificial timing and frequency add to the robotic nature of the stimuli. A future initiative will add the prosodic versions of these sentences to this public stimulus set so that researchers can explore more communicative aspects to language. <strong>2.3 Procedure</strong> Participants were fit with a 128-electrode cap (Bio Semi B.V. Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and seated in a sound attenuating, electrically shielded booth (Industrial Acoustics Company, The Bronx, NY) with a computer monitor (Acer Predator Z35 Curved HD, Acer Inc.) and a standard keyboard (Dell Inc.). The task was created with Presentation® Software (Version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc. Berkeley, CA). The task was first explained to the participant during the consent process and then again before the experimental session. Individuals were asked to refrain from excessive movement and to focus on a fixation cross throughout the task in order to reduce movement artifacts. The experimental session began by explaining the task for a third time. All instructions were presented both visually on the screen and auditorily through the headphones (Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG, USA). Instructions were followed by two practice trials which were the same for every participant. Feedback was given about a participant's response only during practice trials and not during experimental trials. Trials were presented as follows: 1. A fixation cross was on the screen while an auditory sentence stimulus was presented through headphones; 2. A two second pause; and 3. A question (presented both visually and auditorily) asked the participant if the sentence ended as expected, where subjects responded with a right or left arrow key when sentences ended as expected (congruent) or unexpected (incongruent) respectively, to end the trial. A two-second delay was inserted between a subject's response and the start of the next sentence. A total of 442 stimuli were presented to participants in the same order. This was done to ensure that every participant had the same experience throughout the task for every sentence. Two of these stimuli (one congruent and one incongruent) were used for example trials. The remaining 440 were used for the experiment. Stimuli were separated into 11 blocks with optional breaks between each block. Participants could continue onto the next block by pressing the spacebar. After elimination, the responses to 400 out of the 440 stimuli contributed to the analysis of this experiment. <strong>2.4 Data preprocessing</strong> Data were digitized online at a rate of 512Hz, DC to 150 Hz pass-band, and referenced to the common mode sense (CMS) active electrode. EEG data were preprocessed and analyzed offline using in-house scripts leveraging EEGLAB functions (Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004). Data were filtered using a Chebyshev II spectral filter with a band pass of 0.1 - 45 Hz. Channels were rejected automatically if recorded data from an electrode exceeded more than 3 standard deviations from the mean variance and amplitude from all electrodes, the channel would be rejected and interpolated using EEGLAB spherical interpolation. Data were then re-referenced to the common average. Prior to analysis, the time from the beginning of a sentence to the onset of the last word was measured for each stimulus using Praat (PRAAT v. 6.1, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands). These measures were used to adjust the time stamp of each stimulus, so that the data could be aligned to the onset of the last word (i.e. 0 ms), rather than the beginning of the sentence. For all participants, epochs from -200 to 1000 ms were created using a baseline of the 200 ms interval before the onset of the last word. Trials were rejected automatically based on an artifact rejection threshold of 250 mV and if a trial contained amplitudes greater than two standard deviations from the mean amplitude across all channels. Grand average ERP waveforms were generated by first averaging the trials per condition per electrode, and then averaging by participant. <strong>2.5. Statistical analysis</strong> JASP (Jeffrey's Amazing Statistic Program Team [2020], Version 0.12.2) was used for statistical analyses. Three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz) were chosen <em>a priori </em>for investigation (Lau et al., 2008; Luck, 2005; Osterhout and Holcomb, 1992). Other electrodes (F7, T7, and P7) were investigated <em>post hoc</em>. For every participant, these selected electrodes were assessed for an effect of condition using a repeated measure ANOVA (rmANOVA) at four time points of interest (250 ms, 400 ms, 600 ms, and 700 ms). Amplitude values for these electrodes were acquired by averaging the amplitudes across a 10 ms time window, centered at the time point of interest. Additional rmANOVA's were conducted to assess for a main effect of CP, order, linguistic division, and time. F-scores and p-values for a main effect of condition at the midline electrodes are shown in Table 2. Other main effects for midline electrodes are shown in Table 3. All main effects for electrodes F7, T7, and P7 are in Table 4. Topography plot statistics were generated using the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011) for MATLAB and displayed using the EEGLAB toolbox. A group level cluster-based permutation test was conducted using two-tailed, independent sample t-statistics with a critical alpha-level of 0.05. This test applied the Monte-Carlo method to estimate significance probability, the triangulation method of the neighbours function for spatial clustering, and a multiple-comparison correction. Single sample clusters were combined using \""maxsum\"" and a 5% two-sided cutoff criterion was applied to both positive and negative clusters. Topography statistics are presented as the average significance over a 10 ms time window centered at the time point of interest (Figure S2). <strong>2.6 Cloze probability</strong> To further characterize the stimulus set, a RedCap survey was employed to test the CP of all sentence endings. Each sentence in the set was presented with the final word missing (blank) and participants were required to fill in this blank with the first singular word that came to mind. If participants could not think of an answer, they were encouraged to guess rather than leave a blank. Non-answers were not counted towards CP scores; participants were removed from the survey data if they answered fewer than 10 questions out of the 221; and participants were removed if their percent correct was three standard deviations from the mean. After elimination, the survey used the responses from 134 individuals to assess the CP of each sentence. The majority of these stimuli had greater than 80% CP. The CP distribution of sentences were shown in Figure S3. <strong>2.7 Data Availability</strong> This stimulus set (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9ghx3ffkg) and the supporting datasets (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmx4) are available through Dryad for the scientific community to use freely in their experiments.

Neurophysiologically, violations of context-dependent predictions result in amplitude modulations of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) component. While N400 is widely used to measure semantic processing and integration, no publicly-available auditory stimulus set is available to standardize approaches across the field. Here, we developed an auditory stimulus set of 442 sentences that utilized the semantic anomaly paradigm, provided cloze probability for all stimuli, and was developed for both children and adults. With 20 neurotypical adults, we validated that this set elicits robust N400's, as well as two additional semantically-related ERP components: the recognition potential (~250 ms) and the late positivity component (~600 ms). This stimulus set (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9ghx3ffkg) and the 20 high-density (128-channel) electrophysiological datasets (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmx4) are made publicly available to promote data sharing and reuse.

""<strong>2.1 Participants</strong> Twenty-four neurotypical adults were recruited and provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Four subjects were excluded from data analysis due to failure to remain alert or to sit still during data collection (n=2), or due to noisy EEG data (n=2) (Figure S1). The remaining participants make up the fully-analyzed dataset. These twenty subjects ranged in age from 18 to 35 (mean age = 25.5 +/- 4.36), nine were female, and three were left-handed. Every participant spoke English as their first language, and twelve participants were mono-lingual while eight participants reported being bi- or multi- lingual. Demographic information for all participants, including those removed from further analysis are reported in Table 1. <strong>2.2 Stimuli</strong><strong> </strong> The semantic anomaly paradigm consisted of 221 sentence pairs with incongruent and congruent endings, for a total of 442 stimuli in this stimulus set. However, twenty sentence pairs were eliminated before analysis because their endings did not match in syllable number, contained hyphenated phrases, cultural references, or upon closer examination, the supposed incongruent endings were in fact congruent. The remaining 402 stimuli (201 congruent and 201 incongruent sentence pairs) ranged from four to eight words in length. Sentences were created using simple words, derived from a set of age-appropriate words contained in the Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic (MRCP) database (https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc.htm). For example, from the word \""cake\"", the congruent sentence \""He baked a birthday cake\"" was created. The words selected from the MRCP database took into consideration the age of acquisition (from a database provided by (Gilhooly and Logie, 1980)) and/or written word frequency (from a normed written word frequency set (Francis and Kucera, 1967)). This was to ensure that each sentence could be readily comprehended by NT individuals aged 5 years or older. The majority of these age-appropriate words were monosyllabic, but a few basic words with 2-syllables (e.g. present) and 3-syllables (e.g. animal) were included, due to their high-written-word frequency or early age of acquisition. Similar to previous studies using the MRCP database (Ross et al., 2011, 2007), we were sensitive to the fact that everyday language use has changed since the creation of these sets, so we carefully selected words that are still in common use. This stimulus set included sentence pairs where the incongruent endings were just semantic errors. After elimination, this amounts to 132 / 201 stimulus pairs including example stimuli. These incongruent endings were matched to their congruent pair in word type (e.g. noun or verb) and number (e.g. plural or singular). There were also sentence pairs where incongruent endings contained both semantic and syntactic errors. After elimination, this amounts to 69 / 201 stimulus pairs. Semantically incongruent endings were also classified as syntactic errors if the ending deviated from the syntax provided by the sentential context. The type of syntactic errors included: 1. Endings where a plural noun expectation was deviated with a singular noun or vice versa (27 stimulus pairs); 2. Endings where an adjective expectation was deviated with a noun or vice versa (20 stimulus pairs); and 3. Endings where a verb expectation was deviated with a noun or vice versa (22 stimulus pairs). During final analysis, these 3 types of syntactic errors were combined into a single linguistic division (LD) in order to compare the overall response to sentences with both semantic and syntactic errors, and the response to sentences with only semantic errors. Language comprehension in NT individuals is highly influenced by communicative cues such as prosody, especially when sentence meaning relies on syntactic prosodic cues (Thorson 2018, (Cutler et al., 1997; Dahan, 2015; Frazier et al., 2006, Thorson 2018). The intention of this manuscript was to create a stimulus set that could be used for all populations equally. Therefore, this stimulus set was constructed without prosody to ensure that NT individuals would not have an advantage in language comprehension over other populations known to have difficulty with communication or prosody, such as those with ASD (DePape et al., 2012; Eigsti et al., 2012; Martzoukou et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2007; O'Connor, 2012; Wang and Tsao, 2015) or schizophrenia (Leitman et al., 2007, 2005). To do so, individual words from the word list were recorded from a female speaker, instructed to voice the words with minimal inflection, stress, and intonation (i.e. in a monotonous non-prosodic manner). Words were then compiled into complete sentences using the Audacity Software (Version 3.0.0. Audacity® software is copyright © 1999 - 2021 Audacity Team. https://audacity team.org/ ). These artificially-compiled sentences were manually adjusted to have similar pitch-frequency between each word within a sentence and between all sentences. Concurrently, time gaps were added between words so that all sentences would have similar pacing and that researchers would be able to trigger discretely on each word. Both artificial timing and frequency add to the robotic nature of the stimuli. A future initiative will add the prosodic versions of these sentences to this public stimulus set so that researchers can explore more communicative aspects to language. <strong>2.3 Procedure</strong> Participants were fit with a 128-electrode cap (Bio Semi B.V. Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and seated in a sound attenuating, electrically shielded booth (Industrial Acoustics Company, The Bronx, NY) with a computer monitor (Acer Predator Z35 Curved HD, Acer Inc.) and a standard keyboard (Dell Inc.). The task was created with Presentation® Software (Version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc. Berkeley, CA). The task was first explained to the participant during the consent process and then again before the experimental session. Individuals were asked to refrain from excessive movement and to focus on a fixation cross throughout the task in order to reduce movement artifacts. The experimental session began by explaining the task for a third time. All instructions were presented both visually on the screen and auditorily through the headphones (Sennheiser electronic GmbH &amp; Co. KG, USA). Instructions were followed by two practice trials which were the same for every participant. Feedback was given about a participant's response only during practice trials and not during experimental trials. Trials were presented as follows: 1. A fixation cross was on the screen while an auditory sentence stimulus was presented through headphones; 2. A two second pause; and 3. A question (presented both visually and auditorily) asked the participant if the sentence ended as expected, where subjects responded with a right or left arrow key when sentences ended as expected (congruent) or unexpected (incongruent) respectively, to end the trial. A two-second delay was inserted between a subject's response and the start of the next sentence. A total of 442 stimuli were presented to participants in the same order. This was done to ensure that every participant had the same experience throughout the task for every sentence. Two of these stimuli (one congruent and one incongruent) were used for example trials. The remaining 440 were used for the experiment. Stimuli were separated into 11 blocks with optional breaks between each block. Participants could continue onto the next block by pressing the spacebar. After elimination, the responses to 400 out of the 440 stimuli contributed to the analysis of this experiment. <strong>2.4 Data preprocessing</strong> Data were digitized online at a rate of 512Hz, DC to 150 Hz pass-band, and referenced to the common mode sense (CMS) active electrode. EEG data were preprocessed and analyzed offline using in-house scripts leveraging EEGLAB functions (Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004). Data were filtered using a Chebyshev II spectral filter with a band pass of 0.1 - 45 Hz. Channels were rejected automatically if recorded data from an electrode exceeded more than 3 standard deviations from the mean variance and amplitude from all electrodes, the channel would be rejected and interpolated using EEGLAB spherical interpolation. Data were then re-referenced to the common average. Prior to analysis, the time from the beginning of a sentence to the onset of the last word was measured for each stimulus using Praat (PRAAT v. 6.1, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands). These measures were used to adjust the time stamp of each stimulus, so that the data could be aligned to the onset of the last word (i.e. 0 ms), rather than the beginning of the sentence. For all participants, epochs from -200 to 1000 ms were created using a baseline of the 200 ms interval before the onset of the last word. Trials were rejected automatically based on an artifact rejection threshold of 250 mV and if a trial contained amplitudes greater than two standard deviations from the mean amplitude across all channels. Grand average ERP waveforms were generated by first averaging the trials per condition per electrode, and then averaging by participant. <strong>2.5. Statistical analysis</strong> JASP (Jeffrey's Amazing Statistic Program Team [2020], Version 0.12.2) was used for statistical analyses. Three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz) were chosen <em>a priori </em>for investigation (Lau et al., 2008; Luck, 2005; Osterhout and Holcomb, 1992). Other electrodes (F7, T7, and P7) were investigated <em>post hoc</em>. For every participant, these selected electrodes were assessed for an effect of condition using a repeated measure ANOVA (rmANOVA) at four time points of interest (250 ms, 400 ms, 600 ms, and 700 ms). Amplitude values for these electrodes were acquired by averaging the amplitudes across a 10 ms time window, centered at the time point of interest. Additional rmANOVA's were conducted to assess for a main effect of CP, order, linguistic division, and time. F-scores and p-values for a main effect of condition at the midline electrodes are shown in Table 2. Other main effects for midline electrodes are shown in Table 3. All main effects for electrodes F7, T7, and P7 are in Table 4. Topography plot statistics were generated using the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011) for MATLAB and displayed using the EEGLAB toolbox. A group level cluster-based permutation test was conducted using two-tailed, independent sample t-statistics with a critical alpha-level of 0.05. This test applied the Monte-Carlo method to estimate significance probability, the triangulation method of the neighbours function for spatial clustering, and a multiple-comparison correction. Single sample clusters were combined using \""maxsum\"" and a 5% two-sided cutoff criterion was applied to both positive and negative clusters. Topography statistics are presented as the average significance over a 10 ms time window centered at the time point of interest (Figure S2). <strong>2.6 Cloze probability</strong> To further characterize the stimulus set, a RedCap survey was employed to test the CP of all sentence endings. Each sentence in the set was presented with the final word missing (blank) and participants were required to fill in this blank with the first singular word that came to mind. If participants could not think of an answer, they were encouraged to guess rather than leave a blank. Non-answers were not counted towards CP scores; participants were removed from the survey data if they answered fewer than 10 questions out of the 221; and participants were removed if their percent correct was three standard deviations from the mean. After elimination, the survey used the responses from 134 individuals to assess the CP of each sentence. The majority of these stimuli had greater than 80% CP. The CP distribution of sentences were shown in Figure S3. <strong>2.7 Data Availability</strong> This stimulus set (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9ghx3ffkg) and the supporting datasets (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmx4) are available through Dryad for the scientific community to use freely in their experiments.

The satisfaction of basic needs is seen as a prerequisite for motivation and well-being (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). It is unclear, however, how student support can currently be provided, given the social isolation for Swiss university students due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related necessity to teach via electronic formats. As the lack of direct social interaction is one of the most central aspects during the isolation, the planned publication specifically focuses on teachers supporting their students in this respect, thus on university teachers relatedness supportive behavior towards students (Standage et al., 2005) and the subsequent satisfaction of the basic need for relatedness (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002). It is expected that students who perceive their university teachers as relatedness supportive, experience more relatedness satisfaction and subsequently more motivation and well-being despite the challenges of being socially isolated (Mediation). However, research focusing on individual differences has shown that not everyone benefits equally from the satisfaction of basic needs (matching hypothesis, Schüler &amp; Brandstätter, 2013; Schüler, Sheldon, &amp; Fröhlich, 2010). In studies focusing on various basic needs in different life domains (academic learning context, in sports, at the workplace) the authors of the matching hypothesis have shown that the effects of basic need satisfaction depend on the strength of the corresponding motive. For example, they found that people with a high affiliation motive benefited more from the satisfaction of the basic need for relatedness (Schüler et al., 2017; Schüler &amp; Brandstätter, 2013). The affiliation motive is described as the wish to establish, maintain or restore positive relationships with others (Schultheiss &amp; Pang, 2007). Referring to the actual situation, we expect that people with a high affiliation motive suffer more strongly from social distancing. This should be reflected in less satisfaction in everyday life since the introduction of social distancing measures compared to their peers with a low affiliation motive. Second, following the tenets of the matching hypothesis, we expect students with a high affiliation motive to benefit stronger from relatedness need satisfaction in terms of motivation and well-being during online classes (Moderated mediation)1. Beneath focusing on testing the mediation model on relatedness (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000), and the moderated mediation model (Schüler et al., 2010) the present study also aims to consider some of the overall conditions of teaching remotely during social distancing measures, namely the communication channels used by the university teachers (i.e. video chat, podcast, etc.) and the format of the course (i.e. lecture, seminar). Both aspects are expected to affect the abovementioned relationship between relatedness support, relatedness satisfaction and well-being and motivation. Whereas the communication channels chosen by the university teachers themselves are not expected to directly affect students’ need satisfaction, as their effectiveness largely depends on how teachers implement them, we expect the choice of different communication channels to provide the conditions to facilitate or impede the effects of relatedness need supportive behavior (see Decristan et al., 2015; Decristan, Hess, Holzberger, &amp; Praetorius, 2020 for the interplay of so-called sight structures of a lesson and deep structures of learning). Following this logic, we hypothesize that the positive effects of relatedness support on relatedness satisfaction are moderated by the inherent interactive potential of the communication channels used. In a similar vein, we expect that the type of course taught might influence the degree to which relatedness support is possible, the degree to which students experience the satisfaction of their need for relatedness, and their general motivation. Among others, seminars provide ample opportunities for university teachers to interact with their students, lectures are often associated with teacher-centered learning and less interaction between university teachers and students (Bär, Rößling, &amp; Mühlhäuser, 2004; Young, Robinson, &amp; Alberts, 2009). Thus, we expect that the format influences the degree of relatedness supportive behavior. The present study which is preregistered here is part of a larger research project on e-learning at a Swiss university during the COVID-19 pandemic from student and university teacher perspective called “Motivation and well-being of university students and teachers during isolation: The role of supporting the satisfaction of basic needs with an emphasis on relatedness “. Future publications are planned within the project which will not be preregistered here, due to time constraints and resources. Within this preregistration a focus is put on the student. Both the student and university teacher questionnaire are available upon request. Future publications will consider the following topics: - Concordance between student and teacher ratings on relatedness supportive teaching behaviors. - Factors affecting teaching practices and well-being of university teachers during COVID-19 pandemic. Footnote: 1Please note that the matching hypothesis is often tested with implicit motives, which reflect non-conscious and affect-based preferences for certain incentives (e.g. feeling related). Those implicit motives are reflected in long term operant behavior and strongly affect non-declarative measures, such as task-performance or physiological responses (e.g. Schultheiss, 2008; Wegner, Bohnacker, Mempel, Teubel, and Schüler, 2014). However, as the isolation caused by COVID-19 makes the social aspect very salient, we hypothesize that the explicit motive of participants, which is reflected in respondent behavior and declarative measures such as choices and judgments, has a strong impact on whether they benefit from the support of relatedness by the university teacher or not. Due to logistical considerations and the reasoning presented here, we refrain from testing the implicit motive in this study. References Bär, H., Rößling, G., &amp; Mühlhäuser, M. (2004).

To challenge this assumption, we explored whether a language transformer model (BERT) could generate metrics to assess narrative creativity automatically. We collected 790 audio-recorded improvised stories based on varying prompts and used a subset of their transcripts (18) in this preliminary study. Stories with a higher average BERT semantic embedding distance between all sentences were rated as more imaginative (r = 0.48, p = 0.044) and more complex (r = 0.52, p = 0.028) by the average of seven creative storytelling experts. Additionally, sentence-level embedding distances predicted human ratings better than word-level embedding distances (p < 0.05). Together, these findings highlight BERT as a useful tool for automatically assessing narrative creativity and invite further fine-grained investigation of the features that describe creativity in natural communication.\nList of authors and affiliations:\nQingzhi Ruby Zeng: University of Rochester; Derek Lilienthal: California State University, Monterey Bay; Marius Cătălin Iordan: Princeton University; Elise A.

In males, the most common mechanism of drive involves the disruption of sperm bearing one of a pair of alternative alleles. While at least two loci are important for male drive- the driver and the target- linked modifiers can enhance drive, creating selection pressure to suppress recombination. In this work, we investigate the evolution and genomic consequences of an autosomal, multilocus, male meiotic drive system, Segregation Distorter (SD) in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In African populations, the predominant SD chromosome variant, SD-Mal, is characterized by two overlapping, paracentric inversions on chromosome arm 2R and nearly perfect (~100%) transmission. We study the SD-Mal system in detail, exploring its components, chromosomal structure, and evolutionary history. Our findings reveal a recent chromosome-scale selective sweep mediated by strong epistatic selection for haplotypes carrying Sd, the main driving allele, and one or more factors within the double inversion. While most SD-Mal chromosomes are homozygous lethal, SD-Mal haplotypes can recombine with other, complementing haplotypes via crossing over, and with wildtype chromosomes via gene conversion. SD-Mal chromosomes have nevertheless accumulated lethal mutations, excess non-synonymous mutations, and excess transposable element insertions. Therefore, SD-Mal haplotypes evolve as a small, semi-isolated subpopulation with a history of strong selection. These results may explain the evolutionary turnover of SD haplotypes in different populations around the world, and have implications for supergene evolution broadly."",

In males, the most common mechanism of drive involves the disruption of sperm bearing one of a pair of alternative alleles. While at least two loci are important for male drive- the driver and the target- linked modifiers can enhance drive, creating selection pressure to suppress recombination. In this work, we investigate the evolution and genomic consequences of an autosomal, multilocus, male meiotic drive system, Segregation Distorter (SD) in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In African populations, the predominant SD chromosome variant, SD-Mal, is characterized by two overlapping, paracentric inversions on chromosome arm 2R and nearly perfect (~100%) transmission. We study the SD-Mal system in detail, exploring its components, chromosomal structure, and evolutionary history. Our findings reveal a recent chromosome-scale selective sweep mediated by strong epistatic selection for haplotypes carrying Sd, the main driving allele, and one or more factors within the double inversion. While most SD-Mal chromosomes are homozygous lethal, SD-Mal haplotypes can recombine with other, complementing haplotypes via crossing over, and with wildtype chromosomes via gene conversion. SD-Mal chromosomes have nevertheless accumulated lethal mutations, excess non-synonymous mutations, and excess transposable element insertions. Therefore, SD-Mal haplotypes evolve as a small, semi-isolated subpopulation with a history of strong selection. These results may explain the evolutionary turnover of SD haplotypes in different populations around the world, and have implications for supergene evolution broadly."",

However, this technique relies on a priori knowledge of what frequencies contain signal and noise and that these frequencies do not overlap, which is difficult to achieve in practice. To address these issues, we introduce a PO-neural network hybrid model, the Pseudo Projection Operator (PPO), which leverages a neural network to perform frequency selection. We compare the filtering capabilities of a PPO, PO, and denoising autoencoder (DAE) on the University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music Performance Dataset with a variety of added noise types. In the majority of experiments, the PPO outperforms both the PO and DAE. Based upon these results, we suggest future application of the PPO to filtering problems in the physical and biological sciences."",

In particular, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a map of split extensions for holomorphs of two groups. In chapter 3 we construct a resolution for $Hol(Z_{p^r})$ for every prime $p$, where ${\\mathbb Z}_m$ denotes a cyclic group of order $m$, and use it to compute the integer homology and mod $p$ cohomology ring of $Hol(Z_{p^r})$. In chapter 4 we study the holomorph of the direct sum of several copies of $Z_{p^r}$. We identify this holomorph as a nice subgroup of $GL(n+1, Z_{p^r})$, thus its cohomology informs on the cohomology of the general linear group which has been of interest in the subject. We show that the LHS spectral sequence for $H^*(Hol(\\bigoplus_n Z_{p^r}); F_p)$ does not collapse at the $E_2$ stage for $p^r\\ge 8$.

It was shown that a proposed flat lens capable of focussing light with pure geometric phase shifts can switch from being convex to a concave lens or vice versa under these conditions.

The large dimension limit for rotation-invariant variables in atoms is given as an example of a classical limit other than hbar vanishing. Part I concerns the baryon in Rajeev's reformulation of 2d QCD in the large-N limit: a non-linear classical theory of color-singlet quark bilinears. 't Hooft's meson equation is the linearization around the vacuum on the curved grassmannian phase space. The baryon is a topological soliton. Its form factor is found variationally on a succession of increasing rank submanifolds of the phase space. These reduced systems are interacting parton models: a derivation of parton model from the soliton picture. A rank-1 ansatz leads to a Hartree approximation: a relativistic 2d realization of Witten's proposal. The baryon form factor is used to model x_B dependence of deep inelastic structure functions. In Part II, euclidean large-N multi-matrix models are reformulated as classical systems for U(N) invariants. The configuration space of gluon correlations is a space of non-commutative probability distributions. Classical equations of motion (factorized loop equations) contain an anomaly that leads to a cohomological obstruction to finding an action principle. This is circumvented by expressing the configuration space as a coset space of the automorphism group of the tensor algebra. The action principle is interpreted as the Legendre transform of the entropy of operator-valued random variables. The free energy and correlations in the large-N limit are found variationally. The simplest variational ansatz is an analogue of mean-field theory and compares well with exact and numerical solutions of 1 and 2 matrix models away from phase transitions."",

Three randomized controlled trials (Elmira, NY; Memphis, TN; Denver, CO) designed originally to assess program impacts on pregnancy outcomes and maternal and child health through child age 2. Each trial included a control group, a group that received the full intervention (nurse visitation through child age 2), and an alternative treatment group (nurse home visitation through pregnancy only or visitation by paraprofessionals through child age 2). Due to sample size considerations, the Elmira and Denver samples were combined for all mortality analyses. For determining mortality, background information used for determining mortality status was available for all 1138 mothers randomized to a Memphis treatment condition and all but 13 of the live-born children (n=1076). For the combined Elmira and Denver group, background information was available for all 1135 mothers randomized to any one of the treatment conditions and all but 10 of the live born children (n=1087). Pregnant women and their first-born children who were enrolled in one of three trials of the Nurse-Family Partnership (Elmira, Memphis, Denver) were included in the current study. The Elmira sample (N = 400) was enrolled between April 1978 and September 1980 with an 80% recruitment rate. At enrollment, 47% of the participating women were younger than 19 years of age, 62% were unmarried, and 61% came from families in Hollingshead’s social classes IV and V (semi-skilled and unskilled laborers). In the Memphis trial, a total of 1138 out of 1289 eligible women (88.3%) completed informed consent and were randomized from June 1, 1990, through August 31, 1991. We enrolled primarily African American women at less than 29 weeks of gestation, with no previous live births, and with at least 2 of the following socio-demographic risk characteristics: unmarried, less than 12 years of education, and unemployed. Of the women enrolled, 92.1% were African American, 98.1% were unmarried, 64.1% were 18 years or younger at registration, and 85.1% came from households with annual incomes below the US federal poverty guidelines. Denver trial enrollment took place between March 1994 and June 1995 with a total of 735 out of 1178 consecutive pregnant women with no previous live births who were eligible for Medicaid or who had no private health insurance enrolled in the trial and were randomized to control, paraprofessional, or nurse-visited conditions. 86% of participating women were unmarried, 42% were under 19 years of age, 45% were Latino, and on average participants lived in census tracts where 20% of the population was below the poverty line.

Three randomized controlled trials (Elmira, NY; Memphis, TN; Denver, CO) designed originally to assess program impacts on pregnancy outcomes and maternal and child health through child age 2. Each trial included a control group, a group that received the full intervention (nurse visitation through child age 2), and an alternative treatment group (nurse home visitation through pregnancy only or visitation by paraprofessionals through child age 2). Due to sample size considerations, the Elmira and Denver samples were combined for all mortality analyses. For determining mortality, background information used for determining mortality status was available for all 1138 mothers randomized to a Memphis treatment condition and all but 13 of the live-born children (n=1076). For the combined Elmira and Denver group, background information was available for all 1135 mothers randomized to any one of the treatment conditions and all but 10 of the live born children (n=1087). Pregnant women and their first-born children who were enrolled in one of three trials of the Nurse-Family Partnership (Elmira, Memphis, Denver) were included in the current study. The Elmira sample (N = 400) was enrolled between April 1978 and September 1980 with an 80% recruitment rate. At enrollment, 47% of the participating women were younger than 19 years of age, 62% were unmarried, and 61% came from families in Hollingshead’s social classes IV and V (semi-skilled and unskilled laborers). In the Memphis trial, a total of 1138 out of 1289 eligible women (88.3%) completed informed consent and were randomized from June 1, 1990, through August 31, 1991. We enrolled primarily African American women at less than 29 weeks of gestation, with no previous live births, and with at least 2 of the following socio-demographic risk characteristics: unmarried, less than 12 years of education, and unemployed. Of the women enrolled, 92.1% were African American, 98.1% were unmarried, 64.1% were 18 years or younger at registration, and 85.1% came from households with annual incomes below the US federal poverty guidelines. Denver trial enrollment took place between March 1994 and June 1995 with a total of 735 out of 1178 consecutive pregnant women with no previous live births who were eligible for Medicaid or who had no private health insurance enrolled in the trial and were randomized to control, paraprofessional, or nurse-visited conditions. 86% of participating women were unmarried, 42% were under 19 years of age, 45% were Latino, and on average participants lived in census tracts where 20% of the population was below the poverty line. The current study was approved by the University of Rochester Institutional Review Board and the Combined Institutional Review Board of the University of Colorado."",

The contributions of homogeneous and of evanescent waves to two-dimensional near-field diffraction patterns of scalar fields are examined in detail. Exact relations are obtained for calculating these contributions for arbitrary propagation distances, along with approximate expressions for the near field. The behavior of the two contributions is illustrated for the case of a plane wave diffracted by a slit in an opaque screen. The finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method is used examine the influence of exact boundary values on the near field for the case of a slit in a thin perfectly conducting screen. The FD-TD numerical results are displayed in color images that illustrate the intricate behavior of the amplitude and the phase of the field in the vicinity of the slit. These numerical results are compared with the predictions of approximate theories. Some new methods for determining near-fields in rigorous diffraction problems involving thin screens are discussed. Specifically, new approximate theories of diffraction are introduced for both scalar and electromagnetic fields and an iterative Fourier-based algorithm is proposed for solving the rigorous boundary value problem. In order to understand the effects of an optical vortex on diffraction, the field emerging from a spiral phase plate illuminated by a Gaussian beam is examined. It is shown that the amplitude profile of the emerging field changes appreciably over propagation distances that are much smaller than the Rayleigh range."",

The classical Fuglede conjecture in locally compact abelian groups says that a set is spectral if and only if it tiles by translation. This conjecture was disproved by T. Tao in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 5 and higher, using constructions over prime fields (in vector spaces over finite fields of prime order) and lifting them to the Euclidean setting. Over prime fields, when the dimension of the vector space is less than or equal to $2$ it has recently been proven that the Fuglede conjecture holds (see \\cite{IMP15}). In this paper we study this question in higher dimensions over prime fields and provide some results and counterexamples. In particular we prove the existence of spectral sets which do not tile in $\\mathbb{Z}_p^5$ for all odd primes $p$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_p^4$ for all odd primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 3 \\text{ mod } 4$. Although counterexamples in low dimensional groups over cyclic rings $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ were previously known they were usually for non prime $n$ or a small, sporadic set of primes $p$ rather than general constructions.

In this work, we propose a novelend-to-end model to enlarge CAMs generated from classifi-cation models, which can localize targeted objects more pre-cisely. In detail, we add an additional module in traditionalclassification networks to extract foreground object propos-als from images without classifying them into specific cate-gories. Then we set these normalized regions as unrestrictedpixel-level mask supervision for the following classificationtask. We collect a set of images defined as Background ImageSet from the Internet. The number of them is much smallerthan the targeted dataset but surprisingly well supports themethod to extract foreground regions from different pictures.The region extracted is independent from classification task,where the extracted region in each image covers almost en-tire object rather than just a significant part. Therefore, theseregions can serve as masks to supervise the response mapgenerated from classification models to become larger andmore precise.

The advantage of HgCdTe detector arrays is that they can operate at higher temperatures than the currently used arsenic doped silicon detector arrays at the longer wavelengths. Our infrared detector team at the University of Rochester has received and tested four 13 $μm$ detector arrays from Teledyne Imaging Systems with three different pixel designs, two of which are meant to reduce quantum tunneling dark current. The pixel design of one of these arrays has mitigated the effects of quantum tunneling dark currents for which we have been able to achieve, at a temperature of 28 K and applied bias of 350 mV, a well depth of at least 75 $ke^-$ for 90% of the pixels with a median dark current of 1.8 $e^-/sec$.

Existing 3D reconstruction systems inevitably make trade-offs between three conflicting goals: the efficiency of reconstruction (e.g., time and memory requirements), the visual quality of the constructed scene, and the rendering speed on the VR device. This paper proposes a reconstruction system that simultaneously meets all three goals. The key idea is to avoid the resource-demanding process of reconstructing a high-polygon mesh altogether. Instead, we propose to directly transfer details from the original point cloud to a low polygon mesh, which significantly reduces the reconstruction time and cost, preserves the scene details, and enables real-time rendering on mobile VR devices. While our technique is general, we demonstrate it in reconstructing cultural heritage sites. We for the first time digitally reconstruct the Elmina Castle, a UNESCO world heritage site at Ghana, from billions of laser-scanned points. The reconstruction process executes on low-end desktop systems without requiring high processing power, making it accessible to the broad community. The reconstructed scenes render on Oculus Go in 60 FPS, providing a real-time VR experience with high visual quality. Our project is part of the Digital Elmina effort (http://digitalelmina.org/) between University of Rochester and University of Ghana."",

We used the most common ML algorithms for accuracy comparison with a setting of 10-fold cross-validation (briefly, Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Supporting Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, C 5.0 and Stochastic Gradient Boosting). Results: The main findings of this study show that the combination of SD1nu + SD2nu has greater predictive power for MI in comparison to other HRV indexes.

Sentiment transfer is a natural evolution of the heavily-studied style transfer task, as sentiment transfer is rooted in applying the sentiment of a source to be the new sentiment for a target piece of media; yet compared to style transfer, sentiment transfer has been only scantily studied on images. Music sentiment transfer attempts to apply the high level objective of sentiment transfer to the domain of music. We propose CycleGAN to bridge disparate domains. In order to use the network, we choose to use symbolic, MIDI, data as the music format. Through the use of a cycle consistency loss, we are able to create one-to-one mappings that preserve the content and realism of the source data. Results and literature suggest that the task of music sentiment transfer is more difficult than image sentiment transfer because of the temporal characteristics of music and lack of existing datasets."",

Despite multitude of empirical advances, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of different pruning methods. We inspect different pruning techniques under the statistical mechanics formulation of a teacher-student framework and derive their generalization error (GE) bounds. It has been shown that Determinantal Point Process (DPP) based node pruning method is notably superior to competing approaches when tested on real datasets. Using GE bounds in the aforementioned setup we provide theoretical guarantees for their empirical observations. Another consistent finding in literature is that sparse neural networks (edge pruned) generalize better than dense neural networks (node pruned) for a fixed number of parameters. We use our theoretical setup to prove this finding and show that even the baseline random edge pruning method performs better than the DPP node pruning method. We also validate this empirically on real datasets.\nAuthors:\nRupam Acharyya (University of Rochester); Boyu Zhang (University of Rochester); Ankani Chattoraj (University of Rochester); Shouman Das (University of Rochester); Daniel Stefankovic (University of Rochester)\n"",

The broader project is described below: SEEDLingS is a project exploring how infants' early linguistic and environmental input plays a role in their learning. We focus on understanding how babies learn words between 6 and 18 months of age from the visual, social, and linguistic world around them. By looking at the complex environment that babies are exposed to, from their perspective, we can attempt to decode how the developing mind interprets and organizes the objects and words it faces. SEEDLingS is unique in that it combines well-controlled studies in the lab that assess what words infants know, with in-the-home audio and video recordings of what words infants hear, and what they see when they hear these words. Video and audio recordings were generated in the home every month, from 6 to 17 months of age, for a set of 44 infants (with an addition 2 infants who enrolled but then did not end up participating). The goal of this study is to assess infants' language growth over this time period, particularly in the word learning domain. Every two months, infants came into the lab for an eye-tracking study to test their word comprehension (and for older infants, their word production). This volume will eventually include the audio and video recordings from 17 month home visits; right now it's just the videos as we're doing a final cleaning pass on the audio (see details below). The day-long audio recordings were generated using child-perspective LENA recorders (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, United States) worn by the infant. The audio recordings are generated from one single LENA audio recording. The hour-long video recordings show a composite view of infants' typical lives with 1-4 camera feeds. In the standard setup, infants are equipped with 2 headcams, and a centralized camcorder that captures the entire room. The precise arrangement and number of cameras varies per video, as a function of whether the child would wear the hat with the cameras, and whether the cameras' files became corrupt during the recordings. Shared recordings have been scrubbed for certain personal information (e.g. full names, addresses, etc.); this leads to some silent periods on the audio track and some black-out periods on the video track. Only sections of the files that have been verified to contain no extremely personal content by human listeners (or from which such info has been scrubbed) are shared here. If you notice anything that you believe we may have missed in terms of personal information, we ask that you please let us know as soon as possible so we can rectify the issue. Infants in this sample are from the upstate New York area. The sample is generally middle class, with a range of income and an above-average maternal education level. The sample is predominantly white. All infants heard majority English at home (&gt;75%) and had no known vision or hearing issues at birth. These data were collected at the University of Rochester, and continue to be analyzed presently at Duke University.

Our request of all users is that if you create annotations or analyses (e.g. coding of some dimension of the content by hand, automated algorithmic output, etc.) using these data that you share those resources back with us and the broader community so we can continue to enrich this resource. The broader project is described below: SEEDLingS is a project exploring how infants' early linguistic and environmental input plays a role in their learning. We focus on understanding how babies learn words between 6 and 18 months of age from the visual, social, and linguistic world around them. By looking at the complex environment that babies are exposed to, from their perspective, we can attempt to decode how the developing mind interprets and organizes the objects and words it faces. SEEDLingS is unique in that it combines well-controlled studies in the lab that assess what words infants know, with in-the-home audio and video recordings of what words infants hear, and what they see when they hear these words. Video and audio recordings were generated in the home every month, from 6 to 17 months of age, for a set of 44 infants (with an addition 2 infants who enrolled but then did not end up participating). The goal of this study is to assess infants' language growth over this time period, particularly in the word learning domain. Every two months, infants came into the lab for an eye-tracking study to test their word comprehension (and for older infants, their word production). This volume will eventually include the audio and video recordings from 15 month home visits; right now it's just the videos as we're doing a final cleaning pass on the audio (see details below). The day-long audio recordings were generated using child-perspective LENA recorders (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, United States) worn by the infant. The audio recordings are generated from one single LENA audio recording. The hour-long video recordings show a composite view of infants' typical lives with 1-4 camera feeds. In the standard setup, infants are equipped with 2 headcams, and a centralized camcorder that captures the entire room. The precise arrangement and number of cameras varies per video, as a function of whether the child would wear the hat with the cameras, and whether the cameras' files became corrupt during the recordings. Shared recordings have been scrubbed for certain personal information (e.g. full names, addresses, etc.); this leads to some silent periods on the audio track and some black-out periods on the video track. Only sections of the files that have been verified to contain no extremely personal content by human listeners (or from which such info has been scrubbed) are shared here. If you notice anything that you believe we may have missed in terms of personal information, we ask that you please let us know as soon as possible so we can rectify the issue. Infants in this sample are from the upstate New York area. The sample is generally middle class, with a range of income and an above-average maternal education level. The sample is predominantly white. All infants heard majority English at home (&gt;75%) and had no known vision or hearing issues at birth. These data were collected at the University of Rochester, and continue to be analyzed presently at Duke University. PRIVACY AND SCRUBBING INFORMATION: All video files have been completely reviewed and have had sections containing personal information removed. These scrubbed portions of the video will appear blacked-out and silenced. Selected portions of the audio files have been reviewed. Sections containing personal information and the unreviewed sections of the audio files have been silenced. (For month 8-13 ~4 hours/audio file were reviewed for annotation and personal information scrubbing; for month 14-17 ~3 hours).

This volume only includes recordings taken at 8 months of age. [For boring logistical reasons, each month has its own databrary volume though we are likely to consolidate to one DOI in the future] We are sharing these volumes with the community as we finish cleaning them, while several papers using this data are still in the pipeline in the spirit of open science. Our request of all users is that if you create annotations or analyses (e.g. coding of some dimension of the content by hand, automated algorithmic output, etc.) using these data that you share those resources back with us and the broader community so we can continue to enrich this resource. The broader project is described below: SEEDLingS is a project exploring how infants' early linguistic and environmental input plays a role in their learning. We focus on understanding how babies learn words between 6 and 18 months of age from the visual, social, and linguistic world around them. By looking at the complex environment that babies are exposed to, from their perspective, we can attempt to decode how the developing mind interprets and organizes the objects and words it faces. SEEDLingS is unique in that it combines well-controlled studies in the lab that assess what words infants know, with in-the-home audio and video recordings of what words infants hear, and what they see when they hear these words. Video and audio recordings were generated in the home every month, from 6 to 17 months of age, for a set of 44 infants (with an addition 2 infants who enrolled but then did not end up participating). The goal of this study is to assess infants' language growth over this time period, particularly in the word learning domain. Every two months, infants came into the lab for an eye-tracking study to test their word comprehension (and for older infants, their word production). This volume will eventually include the audio and video recordings from 8 month home visits; right now it's just the videos as we're doing a final cleaning pass on the audio (see details below). The day-long audio recordings were generated using child-perspective LENA recorders (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, Colorado, United States) worn by the infant. The audio recordings are generated from one single LENA audio recording. The hour-long video recordings show a composite view of infants' typical lives with 1-4 camera feeds. In the standard setup, infants are equipped with 2 headcams, and a centralized camcorder that captures the entire room. The precise arrangement and number of cameras varies per video, as a function of whether the child would wear the hat with the cameras, and whether the cameras' files became corrupt during the recordings. Shared recordings have been scrubbed for certain personal information (e.g. full names, addresses, etc.); this leads to some silent periods on the audio track and some black-out periods on the video track. Only sections of the files that have been verified to contain no extremely personal content by human listeners (or from which such info has been scrubbed) are shared here. If you notice anything that you believe we may have missed in terms of personal information, we ask that you please let us know as soon as possible so we can rectify the issue. Infants in this sample are from the upstate New York area. The sample is generally middle class, with a range of income and an above-average maternal education level. The sample is predominantly white. All infants heard majority English at home (&gt;75%) and had no known vision or hearing issues at birth. These data were collected at the University of Rochester, and continue to be analyzed presently at Duke University. PRIVACY AND SCRUBBING INFORMATION: All video files have been completely reviewed and have had sections containing personal information removed.

They are most similar to <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. Both of these species usually have the frons and mesepisternum with finer or distinctly separated punctures at least in part, T1 anterior surface shiny, and metasomal terga with basolateral tomentum. Occasional specimens of <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> lack some of these diagnostic characters, and are very difficult to distinguish from <i>L</i>. <i>minckleyi</i> sp. nov. Females of <i>L. mesillense</i> also have the mesoscutum longer (length/width ratio usually ± 0.84); this and the frons punctation seem to be the most reliable diagnostic characters. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>minckleyi</i> sp. nov. can be recognized by the face short (length/width ratio ~0.83) and covered in moderately dense tomentum below the ocelli, flagellomeres relatively short (F2 about 1.6 times as long as F1 and 1.25 times as long as broad), mesepisternum punctures dense (i &lt;1 pd), metasomal terga lacking tomentum, T1–3 rims punctate basally, and clypeus apical margin and labrum usually orange. They are most similar to <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>austerum</i> sp. nov., and <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> have the flagellomeres relatively long (F2 about 2 times as long as F1 and 1.6 times as long as broad), mesepisternum more sparsely punctate (i= 1–2 pd), and metasomal terga sometimes with basolateral tomentum. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>austerum</i> sp. nov. have the face below ocelli covered in sparser tomentum and mesepisternum more sparsely punctate (i ≤ 1 pd). Males of <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. have T1–3 rims impunctate and clypeus apical margin and labrum reddish brown to black. Etymology The specific epithet <i>minckleyi</i> is a dedication to Robert L. Minckley (University of Rochester), who collected the vast majority of currently known specimens. An appropriate translation would be Minckley’s sweat bee.

They are most similar to <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> and <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. Both of these species usually have the frons and mesepisternum with finer or distinctly separated punctures at least in part, T1 anterior surface shiny, and metasomal terga with basolateral tomentum. Occasional specimens of <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> lack some of these diagnostic characters, and are very difficult to distinguish from <i>L</i>. <i>minckleyi</i> sp. nov. Females of <i>L. mesillense</i> also have the mesoscutum longer (length/width ratio usually ± 0.84); this and the frons punctation seem to be the most reliable diagnostic characters. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>minckleyi</i> sp. nov. can be recognized by the face short (length/width ratio ~0.83) and covered in moderately dense tomentum below the ocelli, flagellomeres relatively short (F2 about 1.6 times as long as F1 and 1.25 times as long as broad), mesepisternum punctures dense (i &lt;1 pd), metasomal terga lacking tomentum, T1–3 rims punctate basally, and clypeus apical margin and labrum usually orange. They are most similar to <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i>, <i>L</i>. <i>austerum</i> sp. nov., and <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>mesillense</i> have the flagellomeres relatively long (F2 about 2 times as long as F1 and 1.6 times as long as broad), mesepisternum more sparsely punctate (i= 1–2 pd), and metasomal terga sometimes with basolateral tomentum. Males of <i>L</i>. <i>austerum</i> sp. nov. have the face below ocelli covered in sparser tomentum and mesepisternum more sparsely punctate (i ≤ 1 pd). Males of <i>L</i>. <i>imbriumbrae</i> sp. nov. have T1–3 rims impunctate and clypeus apical margin and labrum reddish brown to black. Etymology The specific epithet <i>minckleyi</i> is a dedication to Robert L. Minckley (University of Rochester), who collected the vast majority of currently known specimens. An appropriate translation would be Minckley’s sweat bee.

Findings – The Rochester study should serve as a wake-up call for librarians that imagine they understand their user-base. Over and over again in this book the authors note how much they learned about the students after studying them systematically and how surprising they found the results. It seems unlikely that the Rochester experience is unique.

The first report of antibiotic-resistant bacteria addresses the story of the American patient carrying the mcr-1 gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic colistin, while the second report proclaims the pathetic death of U.S. patient from septic shock attributed to bacterial infection resistant to treatment with 26 antibiotics. Thus, the rapid development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics coupled with marked changes in the pharmaceutical sector has resulted in a global health crisis; so new antibiotics are urgently needed. Approximately two-thirds of all antibiotics are derived from natural products, so the structural modification of natural products-derived antibiotics by either semi- or total synthesis is a highly successful strategy for discovering novel drugs to address bacterial resistance. My Ph.D. research project comprises of analog development for three main classes: macrolides, albocycline, and aminoglycosides. Macrolides in general and ketolides, in particular, have been widely successful in treating various serious infections affecting lungs (e.g., pneumonia) and skin (e.g. cellulitis) over the past decades. My research of macrolides orients towards establishing a structure-activity relationship (SAR) via developing analogs of solithromycin (current-leading ketolide), that can be accessed via Cu (I) combinatorial click chemistry inspired by Sharpless, in which a library of synthesized and commercial alkynes have been clicked at N-11 azide side chain. Alternatively, synthetic approaches have been applied on the macrolide azide, in order to establish novel scaffolds termed as bis-clicked products that possess supplementary binding pockets. Despite the fact that albocycline (macrolactone) shares similar structural scaffolds with macrolides, it still possesses promising activity for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) as well as vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC = 0.5−1.0 μg/mL). My research of albocycline has established a library of albocycline analogs accessed via cultured albocycline that is isolated from Streptomyces maizeus. However, attempts to functionalize various sites of the albocycline core resulted in poor biological activity reflected with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Therefore, developing novel analogs with improved properties required a better understanding of the mode of action. Initial reports indicated the possibility of albocycline inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis, particularly the peptidoglycan that involves various downstream enzymes MurA to MurZ. Using biochemical pathways and molecular modeling, we concluded that albocycline has an alternative bacterial target. Current efforts in collaboration with Paul Dunman at The University of Rochester (School of Medicine), initiated a genetic approach to identify the target. In this regard, four albocycline-resistant S. aureus strains have been identified by whole-genome sequencing of both mutant and parent (wild-type) and studied to identify the target of albocycline. Preliminary data suggest that albocycline exerts a direct inhibition to the nicotinate pathway in Bacillus subtilis cells, which indirectly causes the blockage of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In short, the long-term goal revolves toward delivering new antibiotics to avert a post-antibiotic era after gaining a better understanding of the antibacterial mechanism of action. Typical strategies to antibiotic discovery require chemical synthesis, lead optimization, accompanied by tedious compound characterization followed by biological evaluation. These approaches are time-consuming and expensive in terms of labor, cost of reagents, and solvents. A promising solution to this problem is found in the emerging field of target-guided synthesis (TGS), wherein the bacterial target assembles its own inhibitor following the principles of fragment-based drug design leading to acceleration in the drug discovery process. On this subject, we have developed seven novel analogs of aminoglycoside neomycin via Cu (I) click chemistry and tested their MICs against resistant strain pikR2. MIC results revealed few analogs that share similar potency with neomycin against pikR2, illustrating the potential for expanding this method further with in situ click experiments. The viability of the proposed in situ click is predicted on previous work established by the Andrade lab, which could explore novel analogs addressing resistance concerns. My final research project centers on the recent advances of C–H activation and its tremendous growth as a hot topic in the synthetic field through the application of longifolene. This triggers us to take advantage of 1,5-Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) to afford cyclization of the seven-membered ring of the molecule. Although longifolene has been previously accessed, it presents a challenging synthesis due to the intricate carbon-carbon framework. Innovative methodology relying on a modified Suarez oxidation (oxygen-centered radical) is proposed to accomplish a formal synthesis of longifolene, which can be expanded for much broader applications."",

Self-actualization was defined as the highest level of need attainment in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Consistency of usage referenced to the regularity with which oral contraceptives were taken.  The null hypothesis of the study was \""there is no relationship between degree of self-actualization and consistency of use of oral contraceptives.\""  Sixty subjects participated in this study.  They were selected from the following areas:  the Planned Parenthood Clinic of Salt Lake City, the nurse-midwifery class at the University of Utah, and the undergraduate nursing class at the University of Rochester.  Each subject had used oral contraceptives as her sole method of birth control for at least the past year and had the same sexual partner during that time.  Two measurement instruments were used in the study, the Personal Orientation Inventory, designed by Everett Shostrom, and a questionnaire, designed by the investigator.  The POI was designed to determine degree of self-actualization and assigned a score for each.  The questionnaire used in this study contained five questions about degree of contraceptive compliance.  In addition, demographic data and data needed to determine whether the subject met criteria for inclusion in the study were elicited.  Every subject in this study received a written explanation of the study, a description of criteria for inclusion in the study, and a consent form.  Those who signed the form were then given a copy of the POI, an answer sheet, and a questionnaire, which they returned to investigator when completed.  The data obtained from the questionnaires and the hand-tabulated scores computed from the POI answer sheet were statistically analyzed using the University of Utah's computer facilities.  The five questions dealing with consistency of oral contraceptive use the most appropriate index of compliance.  The question, \""How many birth control pill do you forget in one menstrual cycle?\"" was selected because it was closely correlated with the other compliance questions and also provided the most precise measure of degree of compliance.  The noncompliance rate obtained in this study, 55%, was almost four times higher than that reported in an earlier study.  The higher rate may have resulted from the different methodology of this and/or the working of the questions related to contraceptive compliance.  The mean POI scores obtained in this investigation were very similar to the mean POI scores computed for the general population.  A wide range of scores was achieved on every scale.  Pearson product-moment correlations were computed, using the data obtained on the twelve POI scales.  The only statistically significant correlation (p"",

Undergraduates are considered full-time if enrolled for 12 or more semester credits, or 12 or more quarter credits, or 24 or more contact hours a week each term. Full-time graduate students are those enrolled for 9 or more semester credits, or 9 or more quarter credits, or a student involved in thesis or dissertation preparation that is considered full time by the institution. Full-time status of students enrolled in doctoral or professional practice programs is reported as defined by the institution.\nData are from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), a web-based data collection system, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics.  All postsecondary institutions that participate in or are applicants for participation in any federal programs providing financial assistance to students are required to report data using the IPEDS. More than 7,500 institutions complete IPEDS surveys each year. These include research universities, state colleges and universities, private religious and liberal arts colleges, for-profit institutions, community and technical colleges, non-degree-granting institutions (eg, beauty colleges), and others. IPEDS collects data on postsecondary education in the United States in seven areas: institutional characteristics, institutional prices, enrollment, student financial aid, degrees and certificates conferred, student persistence and success, and institutional human and fiscal resources.\nThe enrollment data here reports the number of students enrolled in the fall of the reference year at postsecondary institutions. Data are reported by race/ethnicity; gender; enrollment status (part-time or full-time); and or level of study (undergraduate or graduate); also included are counts of nonresident aliens (ie, a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely) enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Students reported include those enrolled in courses creditable toward a degree or other formal award; students enrolled in courses that are part of a vocational or occupational program, including those enrolled in off-campus centers; and high school students taking regular college courses for credit. Fall enrollment is collected in the spring following the fall term covered by the data collection. Other modules are conducted at other times of year.\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/\n\n\nCategory: Education\n\nSubject: Graduate Students, Higher Education, College Students, Undergraduate Students, Full-Time Students, College Enrollment\n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity in the United States for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the US and other nations.

The underlying causes of such behaviors have received considerable attention from psychologists, clinicians, computational theorists, and neuroscientists. These diverse perspectives were showcased in a symposium at the University of Rochester entitled Persistent, Maladaptive Behaviors: Why We Make Bad Choices. Here, we synthesize novel findings and perspectives arising from the symposium and integrate those findings within the broader literature. We begin by reviewing theoretical models of maladaptive behaviors and their underlying neural circuitry. We then discuss the behavioral and clinical manifestations of maladaptive behaviors. Given the multifaceted nature of maladaptive behavior, we argue that a dimensional approach may help inform theoretical models and clinical interventions, particularly those that rely on brain stimulation to induce neuro-plastic changes that rescue and remediate aberrant neural responses. We conclude that an interdisciplinary approach to studying maladaptive behavior will help advance the field toward improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."",

In 2012, a history professor initiated the Seward Family Digital Archive, a student-driven digital humanities project that digitizes, transcribes, and annotates the Seward family correspondence. In order to bridge the divide between the physical collection and the digital project, a project archivist was hired to create an enhanced finding aid and serve as a liaison between special collections, faculty and students working on the project, and library IT staff. The result of this collaboration is a finding aid that links collection description to images, transcriptions, and student research on the digital archive website. This new finding aid, completed in 2018, serves as a comprehensive research tool that greatly increases discoverability of collection materials and serves as an example of the opportunities for intersections between finding aids and digital projects. This project examines the relationship between special collections and digital scholarship and raises the larger questions: What are the next steps in establishing the role of archives in digital scholarship? What should these collaborations look like?"",

The author presents information about hate schemas regarding persons with ASPD and their understanding of the role of hate. The data of 60 prisoners with ASPD, 40 prisoners without ASPD, and 60 men without antisocial tendencies, has been analyzed. The participants were asked to describe their hate inspired by a photograph. The narrative discourse was analyzed, the three groups were compared. The results show the differences between the inmates with ASPD, those without ASPD, and the controls. The antisocial individuals describe hate as an ambivalent feeling with low emotional intensity, i.e., actors (in stories) are presented more as positives than as partners. They use different mechanisms to keep them from understanding the meaning of the emotional situation. The schema's characteristics were expressed in narratives attributed to high Psychopathy."",

The author presents information about hate schemas regarding persons with ASPD and their understanding of the role of hate. The data of 60 prisoners with ASPD, 40 prisoners without ASPD, and 60 men without antisocial tendencies, has been analyzed. The participants were asked to describe their hate inspired by a photograph. The narrative discourse was analyzed, the three groups were compared. The results show the differences between the inmates with ASPD, those without ASPD, and the controls. The antisocial individuals describe hate as an ambivalent feeling with low emotional intensity, i.e., actors (in stories) are presented more as positives than as partners. They use different mechanisms to keep them from understanding the meaning of the emotional situation. The schema's characteristics were expressed in narratives attributed to high Psychopathy."",

It explores issues arising from multiple case studies of trainee teachers learning experiences in innovating traditional games. A qualitative methodology was adopted through observations, semi-structured interviews and reflective journals' content analysis of trainee teachers' learning experiences creating and implementing innovative traditional games. Twelve groups of 36 trainee teachers who registered for Sports and Physical Education Management Course were the participants for this research during the traditional game carnival. Semi structured interviews were administrated after the trainee teachers learning experiences in creating innovative traditional games. Reflective journals were collected after carnival day and the content analyzed. Inductive data analysis was used to evaluate various data sources. All the collected data were then evaluated through the Nvivo data analysis process. Inductive reasoning was interpreted based on the Self Determination Theory (SDT). The findings showed that the trainee teachers had positive game participation experiences, game knowledge about traditional games and positive motivation to innovate the game. The data also revealed the influence of themes like cultural significance and creativity. It can be concluded from the findings that the organized game carnival, as a requirement of course work by the Institute of Teacher Training Malaysia, was able to enhance teacher trainers' innovative thinking skills. The SDT, as a multidimensional approach to motivation, was utilized. Therefore, teacher trainers may have more learning experiences using the SDT."",

It explores issues arising from multiple case studies of trainee teachers learning experiences in innovating traditional games. A qualitative methodology was adopted through observations, semi-structured interviews and reflective journals' content analysis of trainee teachers' learning experiences creating and implementing innovative traditional games. Twelve groups of 36 trainee teachers who registered for Sports and Physical Education Management Course were the participants for this research during the traditional game carnival. Semi structured interviews were administrated after the trainee teachers learning experiences in creating innovative traditional games. Reflective journals were collected after carnival day and the content analyzed. Inductive data analysis was used to evaluate various data sources. All the collected data were then evaluated through the Nvivo data analysis process. Inductive reasoning was interpreted based on the Self Determination Theory (SDT). The findings showed that the trainee teachers had positive game participation experiences, game knowledge about traditional games and positive motivation to innovate the game. The data also revealed the influence of themes like cultural significance and creativity. It can be concluded from the findings that the organized game carnival, as a requirement of course work by the Institute of Teacher Training Malaysia, was able to enhance teacher trainers' innovative thinking skills. The SDT, as a multidimensional approach to motivation, was utilized. Therefore, teacher trainers may have more learning experiences using the SDT."",

This paper presents a theoretical framework for using Social Stories in conjunction with the creative arts. The paper argues that Bandura's social learning theory can be used to explain the mechanisms behind Social Stories and the way they influence changes in response, while Gardner's multiple intelligences theory can be used simultaneously to demonstrate the role of the creative arts in learning. By using Social Stories with the creative arts for individuals on the autistic spectrum, the aim is to meet individual needs and help individuals with autism to develop in different areas of learning and communication."",

The acting standards were approved in 1996. Furthermore, there are no optimum criteria defining capability of the Healthcare Institutions to train certain number of interns. The study deals with the issue of requirements to the Ukrainian Healthcare Institutions for training interns specializing in “obstetrics and gynecology”, “anesthesiology” and “surgery”. <strong>Study methods. </strong>Requirements for internship training bases of intern’s information are studied, determined and summarized on the basis of information material’s analysis of the sites of 7 Medical schools of the USA, forms of statistical reporting of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 17 “Report on medical personnel” and literature review. Medical schools in the fields of “Obstetrics and Gynecology”, “Anesthesiology’, and “General Surgery” were selected for analysis. Statistical analysis of the study materials was performed using the Microsoft Excel software package. <strong>Results.</strong> The authors have established that the general requirements for the internship centers include: general characteristics of the center by the number of interventions related to the specialization of the interns ( operations, anesthesia cases, deliveries, Caesarian sections, etc.), regarding the procedures related to the main specialization and subspecialization; present facilities (equipment, rooms); requirements to the managers and heads of the centers (qualification, work experience, professional actualization); number of conducted procedures per one physician (obstetrician or gynecologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon, depending on the intern specialization); outcomes of the interventions (deliveries, anesthesia cases) corresponding to the intern specialization. The authors have defined that the maternity home as an internship center must serve not less than 3500 delivery cases, considering 150 deliveries per 1 intern, i.e. 24 interns are trained during 3 years of internship in the institution. To provide for training of anesthesiologists rotation in 9 departments is necessary, 600 anesthesia cases should be conducted. The estimated number of interns in Ukraine should make up 14% of total amount of physicians in the Healthcare system. The authors suppose that in Ukraine the total amount of interns of their first internship year makes 350 people in obstetrics and gynecology, 500 – in anesthesiology and 340 – in surgery. <strong>Conclusions.</strong> The training of interns in the healthcare institutions requires introduction of new complex requirement standards providing for the appropriate medical service volume, facilities and staff.

Діючі вимоги були ухвалені в 1996 році. До того ж в Україні відсутні оптимальні критерії для розрахунку спроможності закладів охорони здоров’я до підготовки певної кількості лікарів-інтернів. Дослідження присвячене проблемі визначення вимог до закладів охорони здоров’я для підготовки лікарів-інтернів в Україні до незалежної практики за спеціальностями “акушерство і гінекологія”, “анестезіологія”, “хірургія”. <strong>Методи дослідження. </strong>Вимоги до баз стажування для підготовки лікарів-інтернів вивчені, визначені та узагальнені на підставі аналізу матеріалів інформації сайтів 7 медичних шкіл США, форм статистичної звітності МОЗ України № 17 “Звіт про медичні кадри” та огляду літератури. Для аналізу були відібрані медичні школи за спеціальностями “Акушерство і гінекологія”, “Анестезіологія”, “Загальна хірургія”. Статистичний аналіз матеріалів дослідження виконано за допомогою пакета програм “Excel Microsoft”. <strong>Результати.</strong> Встановлено, що до загальних вимог до баз стажування для підготовки лікарів-інтернів належить загальна характеристика бази стажування за кількістю процедур за напрямком підготовки лікаря-інтерна (операцій, анестезій, пологів, кесарів розтинів тощо) з урахуванням процедур за основними напрямками підготовки та субспеціальностями; наявні матеріально-технічні ресурси (обладнання, приміщення); вимоги до керівників баз стажування (кваліфікація, досвід роботи, професійний розвиток); кількість процедур на одного лікаря (акушер-гінеколога, анестезіолога, хірурга, в залежності від спеціальності підготовки лікаря-інтерна); результати операцій (пологів, анестезій), що виконуються лікарями за спеціальністю підготовки лікаря-інтерна. Визначено, що обсяг пологового будинку як бази стажування повинен бути не менше 3500 пологів, з урахуванням 150 пологів на 1 лікаря-інтерна, тобто 24 лікаря-інтерна впродовж трьох років навчання в інтернатурі в одному закладі. Для забезпечення підготовки лікарів-анестезіологів необхідно обов`язково забезпечити ротацію в 9 відділеннях та створити умови для виконання 600 анестезій. Встановлено, що розрахункова кількість лікарів-інтернів в Україні повинна становити 14% від загальної кількості лікарів по спеціальності в галузі охорони здоров`я. Ймовірно, що в Україні одночасно на перший рік інтернатури з акушерства та гінекології максимальна кількість лікарів-інтернів становить 350 осіб, з анестезіології – 500 осіб, з хірургії – 340 осіб. Висновок. Для підготовки лікарів-інтернів в закладах охорони здоров’я необхідно запровадити нові комплексні вимоги, які будуть передбачати обсяги медичної допомоги, матеріально-технічні та кадрові ресурси."",

The acting standards were approved in 1996. Furthermore, there are no optimum criteria defining capability of the Healthcare Institutions to train certain number of interns. The study deals with the issue of requirements to the Ukrainian Healthcare Institutions for training interns specializing in “obstetrics and gynecology”, “anesthesiology” and “surgery”. <strong>Study methods. </strong>Requirements for internship training bases of intern’s information are studied, determined and summarized on the basis of information material’s analysis of the sites of 7 Medical schools of the USA, forms of statistical reporting of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 17 “Report on medical personnel” and literature review. Medical schools in the fields of “Obstetrics and Gynecology”, “Anesthesiology’, and “General Surgery” were selected for analysis. Statistical analysis of the study materials was performed using the Microsoft Excel software package. <strong>Results.</strong> The authors have established that the general requirements for the internship centers include: general characteristics of the center by the number of interventions related to the specialization of the interns ( operations, anesthesia cases, deliveries, Caesarian sections, etc.), regarding the procedures related to the main specialization and subspecialization; present facilities (equipment, rooms); requirements to the managers and heads of the centers (qualification, work experience, professional actualization); number of conducted procedures per one physician (obstetrician or gynecologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon, depending on the intern specialization); outcomes of the interventions (deliveries, anesthesia cases) corresponding to the intern specialization. The authors have defined that the maternity home as an internship center must serve not less than 3500 delivery cases, considering 150 deliveries per 1 intern, i.e. 24 interns are trained during 3 years of internship in the institution. To provide for training of anesthesiologists rotation in 9 departments is necessary, 600 anesthesia cases should be conducted. The estimated number of interns in Ukraine should make up 14% of total amount of physicians in the Healthcare system. The authors suppose that in Ukraine the total amount of interns of their first internship year makes 350 people in obstetrics and gynecology, 500 – in anesthesiology and 340 – in surgery. <strong>Conclusions.</strong> The training of interns in the healthcare institutions requires introduction of new complex requirement standards providing for the appropriate medical service volume, facilities and staff. Keywords: healthcare, facilities, internships, interns, requirements, criteria. <strong>ВИМОГИ ДО ЗАКЛАДІВ ОХОРОНИ ЗДОРОВ’Я З ПІДГОТОВКИ ЛІКАРІВ-ІНТЕРНІВ В УКРАЇНІ </strong> В Україні відсутні сучасні вимоги до закладів охорони здоров’я, як до баз підготовки лікарів-інтернів. Діючі вимоги були ухвалені в 1996 році. До того ж в Україні відсутні оптимальні критерії для розрахунку спроможності закладів охорони здоров’я до підготовки певної кількості лікарів-інтернів. Дослідження присвячене проблемі визначення вимог до закладів охорони здоров’я для підготовки лікарів-інтернів в Україні до незалежної практики за спеціальностями “акушерство і гінекологія”, “анестезіологія”, “хірургія”. <strong>Методи дослідження. </strong>Вимоги до баз стажування для підготовки лікарів-інтернів вивчені, визначені та узагальнені на підставі аналізу матеріалів інформації сайтів 7 медичних шкіл США, форм статистичної звітності МОЗ України № 17 “Звіт про медичні кадри” та огляду літератури. Для аналізу були відібрані медичні школи за спеціальностями “Акушерство і гінекологія”, “Анестезіологія”, “Загальна хірургія”. Статистичний аналіз матеріалів дослідження виконано за допомогою пакета програм “Excel Microsoft”. <strong>Результати.</strong> Встановлено, що до загальних вимог до баз стажування для підготовки лікарів-інтернів належить загальна характеристика бази стажування за кількістю процедур за напрямком підготовки лікаря-інтерна (операцій, анестезій, пологів, кесарів розтинів тощо) з урахуванням процедур за основними напрямками підготовки та субспеціальностями; наявні матеріально-технічні ресурси (обладнання, приміщення); вимоги до керівників баз стажування (кваліфікація, досвід роботи, професійний розвиток); кількість процедур на одного лікаря (акушер-гінеколога, анестезіолога, хірурга, в залежності від спеціальності підготовки лікаря-інтерна); результати операцій (пологів, анестезій), що виконуються лікарями за спеціальністю підготовки лікаря-інтерна. Визначено, що обсяг пологового будинку як бази стажування повинен бути не менше 3500 пологів, з урахуванням 150 пологів на 1 лікаря-інтерна, тобто 24 лікаря-інтерна впродовж трьох років навчання в інтернатурі в одному закладі. Для забезпечення підготовки лікарів-анестезіологів необхідно обов`язково забезпечити ротацію в 9 відділеннях та створити умови для виконання 600 анестезій. Встановлено, що розрахункова кількість лікарів-інтернів в Україні повинна становити 14% від загальної кількості лікарів по спеціальності в галузі охорони здоров`я. Ймовірно, що в Україні одночасно на перший рік інтернатури з акушерства та гінекології максимальна кількість лікарів-інтернів становить 350 осіб, з анестезіології – 500 осіб, з хірургії – 340 осіб. Висновок. Для підготовки лікарів-інтернів в закладах охорони здоров’я необхідно запровадити нові комплексні вимоги, які будуть передбачати обсяги медичної допомоги, матеріально-технічні та кадрові ресурси."",

We used 8- to 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice acquired from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). In all experiments, animals were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Depth of anesthesia was determined by the pedal reflex test. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5C with a rectal probe-controlled heated platform, and ECG and respiratory rate were monitored using a small animal physiological monitoring system (Harvard Apparatus). Anesthetized mice were fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and two cannulae were implanted into the right lateral ventricle (0.85 mm lateral, 2.10 mm ventral and 0.22 mm caudal to bregma) and the cisterna magna, as previously described (2).

His narrative also includes his memories of co-workers, and explanations of how the farm operated efficiently, from planting, harvesting, packaging, delivering, to selling crops. John's parents were originally relocated to the Gila River Relocation Center in Arizona, before arriving at Seabrook.  John attended the University of Rochester under the Student Relocation Program.

Low response rates and toxicity profiles have, thus far, limited the widespread use of cytotoxic chemotherapy in this setting. In this update, we review three abstracts from the 2014 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium that present outcomes of the use of combination capecitabine and temozolomide in patients with advanced pNET.

His over 100 invited lectures include presentations in Poland, Belgium, France, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Australia, England, Sweden, Norway, and Australia.\nBrock has been a leading contributor to the development of methods of intertemporal equilibrium analysis in the areas of growth theory, monetary theory, and finance. More recently, he has played a crucial role in the development of new methods for the analysis of nonlinear dynamics in macroeconomics and finance, and models of expectations that relax the assumption of rational expectations. I interviewed Buz in the faculty cafeteria near the Social Science Research Institute building, on the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin, on October 22, 1998. Our interview was interrupted when he had to go to teach, and then was finished by phone on December 11, 1998. The transcript that follows does little justice to the liveliness of Buz’s conversation, mainly because of my inability to transcribe the animated facial expressions and hand gestures that made the mathematical references more concrete. I have added several footnotes to the transcript, identifying some of the published sources that were mentioned during our conversation."",

Newhouse School of Public Communications. We intend to develop an indepth understanding of one multi-disciplinary academic culture and then to examine the library’s culture and work practices to discover where services and resources are meeting needs and where they are not. The qualitative methods used in the Patterns of Culture project is informed by the ethnographic work conducted at the University of Rochester. The research team, four librarians and a graduate assistant, received training in interview and observational techniques from anthropologist Nancy Foster. Our data gathering, conducted from spring 2007 to spring 2008, involved interviews with faculty, librarians, and students about their work practice, eliciting photographic diaries from students and conducting observations in classrooms and public spaces. The goal of the Patterns of Culture (after Ruth Benedict’s landmark work) is threefold: to gain a better understanding of the needs, research, and work practices of the faculty and students and to gain the same type of understanding of library staff; to develop a plan to align library culture, resources, and services more closely with the needs of faculty and students; and to produce a model for data gathering and analysis that can be applied by the library to other academic settings. Our project is unusual in that it applies the same ethnographic methods to three groups, using comparison as a means for deeper understanding.""

Data Planet™ Statistical Datasets: A SAGE Publishing Resource Dataset-ID: 069-001-001 Dataset: Presents statistics on participation in intercollegiate sports teams by sport activity and gender. The data are segmented by participation on men’s teams, men’s teams and coed teams, women’s teams, or women’s teams and coed teams. Data are reported for postsecondary institutions in the United States that participate in financial aid programs and that have intercollegiate varsity sports programs. Any coeducational postsecondary institution in the United States that participates in the federal student financial assistance programs and has an intercollegiate athletic program is required by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 USC 1092(g) (also known as the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act [EADA]), to participate in the annual EADA data collection. Through this survey, data are collected by the US Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education on athletic participation, staffing, and revenues and expenses, by men's, women's, and coed varsity teams. The Department of Education uses this information in preparing its required report to the Congress on gender equity in intercollegiate athletics. EADA survey results are also made publicly available and are intended to help make prospective students aware of a school's commitment to providing equitable athletic opportunities for male and female students. The dataset presented here includes data on all reporting institutions by school year for a consecutive twelve-month period of time designated by the institution for the purposes of the EADA Report. (Note that the year indicated refers to the beginning of the school year: eg, 2011 represents the period 2011-2012.) http://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list Category: Education Subject: Athletic Programs, College Sports, Higher Education, Gender, Athletes Source: Office of Postsecondary Education The mission of the United States Department of Education (DOE) is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. The DOE was created in 1980 by combining offices from several federal agencies. Today, its work focuses on establishing policies on federal financial aid for education, and distributing as well as monitoring those funds; collecting data on US schools and disseminating research; focusing national attention on key educational issues; and prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal access to education. The Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) of the DOE formulates federal postsecondary education policy and administers programs that support the mission to increase access to quality postsecondary education, particularly for low-income, first-generation, and disadvantaged students. The policy arm of the OPE develops postsecondary education policy and legislative proposals and is responsible for budget formulation and forecasting for programs administered by OPE. The Accreditation Group administers the OPE's review process of accrediting agencies and state approval agencies for postsecondary vocational education and nurse education seeking to obtain initial and continued recognition by the Secretary of Education, carries out the Secretary's responsibility to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies and associations that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities as to the quality of education and training offered by postsecondary institutions and programs, provides recommendations to the Secretary regarding the recognition of accrediting agencies as reliable authorities, and makes determinations as to whether the standards used by foreign countries to accredit medical schools are comparable to the standards used to accredit programs leading to the MD degree in the US.

Data are from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), a web-based data collection system, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. All postsecondary institutions that participate in or are applicants for participation in any federal programs providing financial assistance to students are required to report data using the IPEDS. More than 7,500 institutions complete IPEDS surveys each year. These include research universities, state colleges and universities, private religious and liberal arts colleges, for-profit institutions, community and technical colleges, non-degree-granting institutions (eg, beauty colleges), and others. IPEDS collects data on postsecondary education in the United States in seven areas: institutional characteristics, institutional prices, enrollment, student financial aid, degrees and certificates conferred, student persistence and success, and institutional human and fiscal resources. The enrollment data here reports the number of students enrolled in the fall of the reference year at postsecondary institutions. Data are reported by race/ethnicity; gender; enrollment status (part-time or full-time); and or level of study (undergraduate or graduate); also included are counts of nonresident aliens (ie, a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely) enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Students reported include those enrolled in courses creditable toward a degree or other formal award; students enrolled in courses that are part of a vocational or occupational program, including those enrolled in off-campus centers; and high school students taking regular college courses for credit. Fall enrollment is collected in the spring following the fall term covered by the data collection. Other modules are conducted at other times of year. http://nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/ Category: Education Subject: Graduate Students, Higher Education, College Students, Undergraduate Students, College Enrollment Source: National Center for Education Statistics The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity in the United States for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the US and other nations. NCES is located within the US Department of Education and the Institute of Education Sciences. The NCES fulfills a congressional mandate to collect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of US education; conduct and publish reports; and review and report on education activities internationally. The NCES is one of four centers (along with the National Center for Education Research, the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, and the National Center for Special Education Research) charged with carrying out the work of the Institute of Education Sciences. http://nces.ed.gov/"",

Data Planet™ Statistical Datasets: A SAGE Publishing Resource Dataset-ID: 017-005-001 Dataset: Presents a count of full- and part-time students of all levels enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the 50 United States, and Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Data are from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), a web-based data collection system, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. All postsecondary institutions that participate in or are applicants for participation in any federal programs providing financial assistance to students are required to report data using the IPEDS. More than 7,500 institutions complete IPEDS surveys each year. These include research universities, state colleges and universities, private religious and liberal arts colleges, for-profit institutions, community and technical colleges, non-degree-granting institutions (eg, beauty colleges), and others. IPEDS collects data on postsecondary education in the United States in seven areas: institutional characteristics, institutional prices, enrollment, student financial aid, degrees and certificates conferred, student persistence and success, and institutional human and fiscal resources. The enrollment data here reports the number of students enrolled in the fall of the reference year at postsecondary institutions. Data are reported by race/ethnicity; gender; enrollment status (part-time or full-time); and or level of study (undergraduate or graduate); also included are counts of nonresident aliens (ie, a person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely) enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Students reported include those enrolled in courses creditable toward a degree or other formal award; students enrolled in courses that are part of a vocational or occupational program, including those enrolled in off-campus centers; and high school students taking regular college courses for credit. Fall enrollment is collected in the spring following the fall term covered by the data collection. Other modules are conducted at other times of year. http://nces.ed.gov/IPEDS/ Category: Education Subject: Graduate Students, Higher Education, College Students, Undergraduate Students, College Enrollment Source: National Center for Education Statistics The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity in the United States for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the US and other nations. NCES is located within the US Department of Education and the Institute of Education Sciences. The NCES fulfills a congressional mandate to collect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of US education; conduct and publish reports; and review and report on education activities internationally. The NCES is one of four centers (along with the National Center for Education Research, the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, and the National Center for Special Education Research) charged with carrying out the work of the Institute of Education Sciences. http://nces.ed.gov/"",

Participants remained separated in their private testing rooms and were told they were about to discuss a hypothetical event with their romantic partner. One person was randomly assigned to be the discloser of good news: Experimenters incorporated the participants' answers from the initial questionnaire and indicated to disclosers they had been hypothetically hired for their “dream” job or accepted into their “dream” graduate program. The other members of the romantic dyads—the responders—were informed that their partners received this good news. After role assignment, we implemented a manipulation of the conversation context. In the noncorrespondent condition, couples were told to imagine having to live apart from their partners and endure a long- distance relationship. The news was noncorrespondent for disclosers because the pursuit of their dream job (i.e., self-directed goal) conflicted with their relationship-directed goal. The news was also non- correspondent for responders who would have to endure a long-distance relationship so that their partners could pursue their dream jobs. In the correspondent condition, couples were told to imagine they could live together, with the news being positive for disclosers, responders, and the relationship. Participants were explicitly asked to discuss how this news would make each of them feel and how the news would impact their relationship in the short-term and the long-term. After receiving manipulation instructions, disclosers and responders remained in their private testing rooms for an anticipatory period during which they were given three minutes to “gather their thoughts” to prepare for the conversation. A set of double doors that separated the two private testing rooms was opened to create one, large dyad room when the preparation period ended. Couples then engaged in a conversation for 5-min. After the conversation, participants returned to their private testing rooms for a 3 min recovery period and completed questionnaires. Then, couples reversed roles, such that the discloser in the first conversation was now in the responder role and vice versa. We followed up with couples 3 months after the laboratory session."",

METHODS: Nine hundred seventy-three cancer patients completed an information needs-assessment questionnaire prior to starting treatment at 20 geographically distinct clinical cancer sites within the University of Rochester Community Clinical Oncology Program network. Chi2 Test was used to examine the association between race/ethnicity and education, occupation, and perception and use of available information. T test and analysis of covariance were used to examine race/ethnicity-based differences in concerns over understanding cancer diagnosis/treatment plan and the effect of race/ethnicity controlling for demographics. RESULTS: There were 904 non-Hispanic white and 69 nonwhite (blacks, Latinos, and others) patients in the sample. Whites and nonwhites were comparable in educational attainment and occupation. However, there was a statistically significant race/ethnicity-based difference in concerns over understanding the diagnosis and treatment plan for cancer, even after controlling for sex (male, female), age, education, and occupation (p &lt; .001). More nonwhite patients indicated that additional information would have been helpful in dealing with these concerns (p"",

It so happened that Madeleine Grumet was chair of the Education Department there, and through her, I was introduced to William Pinar, who taught nearby at the University of Rochester. Subsequently, when he took a leave of absence to teach at Colgate University, he asked me to cover his course for secondary English student teachers and supervise them in the field. One of the books he had selected for the course that term was Jean Paul Sartre’s What is Literature? (1978). It was a difficult text for the students, and I remember that some complained that they could not understand what this had to do with the concerns they faced as student teachers “in the trenches” each day. But the struggle with this text, like all struggles, was necessary; and in the end, everyone in the seminar agreed that the book had made them think about their work in new ways, and had renewed their sense of commitment to teaching. Sartre called upon these student teachers, myself, and the graduate assistant for that seminar (a young man named William Reynolds), to make a difference through our work, and to teach within “the situation,” to use Sartre’s term. “The situation” was, for Sartre, the situation at hand, the situation that confronted us personally and concretely, but also culturally and historically. Literature was not just literature, not just art for art’s sake. The writer speaks to the present, to our times, wittingly or unwittingly, and for Sartre it is best that we speak wittingly, as active subjects of history, engaged in the battles currently being waged over the course and direction of democratic public life."",

It documents the life of Monica, an American woman born with congenital atrasia of the esophagus who was fed by a gastric fistula until 2 years of age when corrective surgery was performed. The project began in October of 1953 when Drs. Franz Reichsman and George Engel met Monica, age 15 months, while she was hospitalized for retarded growth and development, depression and malnutrition. What began then as a limited case study of depression in an infant with a gastric fistula expanded into an intensive, multimethod, multimedia, longitudinal exploration of her life. After filming and testing Monica during this nine month hospital stay, the research team continued to follow her development after reconstructive surgery of the esophagus at age two, into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Monica married at age 19 and bore four daughters over the next seven years. Data collection of Monica, her mother, siblings, husband and four children, continued until Murray Center acquisition of the data in 1995. Investigators anticipate continued contact with Monica and her family in the future.  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (11 hours of silent film (transferred to video) dating from 1953 to 1976; 40 hours of video, dating from 1972 to 1994; 232 interviews (with Monica and family members); 252 psychological tests (including projective, personality, and intelligence tests of Monica and family); 464 notes from observation of laboratory testing sessions, 39 notes from phone conversations; 148 transcripts of laboratory sessions; 57 pieces of artwork (by Monica, her siblings, and her children); 36 items of correspondence; 30 experiments; 56 medical notes; 6 newspaper articles; 145 other notes and items; 1586 photographs; and 248 audiotapes of laboratory sessions).

Beginning with Fiscal Year 2000, the Academic Libraries Survey is no longer a component of IPEDS, but remains on a two-year cycle.\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/aca_data.asp\n\n\nCategory: Education\n\nSubject: Expenditures, Purchases, Collections, Books, Academic Libraries\n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity in the United States for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the US and other nations. NCES is located within the US Department of Education and the Institute of Education Sciences. The NCES fulfills a congressional mandate to collect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of US education; conduct and publish reports; and review and report on education activities internationally. The NCES is one of four centers (along with the National Center for Education Research, the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, and the National Center for Special Education Research) charged with carrying out the work of the Institute of Education Sciences.\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/"",

Through three case studies of artifacts originally produced for religious use, (1) a thirteenth-century medieval Spanish Crucifix in the Memorial Art Gallery at the University of Rochester, New York, (2) an early twentieth-century Iraqi Tik at the North Carolina Museum of Art, and (3) a fourteenth-century Iranian Mihrab at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I trace the ways through which religious artifacts are reframed as objects of fine art that are collected and exhibited in fine arts museums. As religious artifacts are incorporated into the museum industry, they are encoded with new secularized meanings through the disciplinary lens of academic art history, altering their original religious value and replacing it with aesthetic value. Further, the narratives that fine arts museums tell about their own histories, which immortalize founders, donors, buildings, and collections, eclipse the religious significance of the particular religious artifacts contained within fine arts museums. As the fine arts museum itself comes to be memorialized and valued in religious ways, religious artifacts, in turn, are secularized through the twin processes of aestheticization and musealization."",

Indeed, in a considerable number of cases, Ta and T1 tumors look very similar under microscope, making the distinction very difficult even for experienced pathologists. Thus, there is an urgent need for a favoring system based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish between the two stages of bladder cancer. Methods A total of 1177 images of bladder tumor tissues stained by hematoxylin and eosin were collected by pathologists at University of Rochester Medical Center, which included 460 non-invasive (stage Ta) and 717 invasive (stage T1) tumors. Automatic pipelines were developed to extract features for three invasive patterns characteristic to the T1 stage bladder cancer (i.e., desmoplastic reaction, retraction artifact, and abundant pinker cytoplasm), using imaging processing software ImageJ and CellProfiler. Features extracted from the images were analyzed by a suite of machine learning approaches. Results We extracted nearly 700 features from the Ta and T1 tumor images. Unsupervised clustering analysis failed to distinguish hematoxylin and eosin images of Ta vs. T1 tumors. With a reduced set of features, we successfully distinguished 1177 Ta or T1 images with an accuracy of 91–96% by six supervised learning methods. By contrast, convolutional neural network (CNN) models that automatically extract features from images produced an accuracy of 84%, indicating that feature extraction driven by domain knowledge outperforms CNN-based automatic feature extraction. Further analysis revealed that desmoplastic reaction was more important than the other two patterns, and the number and size of nuclei of tumor cells were the most predictive features. Conclusions We provide a ML-empowered, feature-centered, and interpretable diagnostic system to facilitate the accurate staging of Ta and T1 diseases, which has a potential to apply to other types of cancer."",

The bioavailable estradiol concentration accounts for aberrations in estradiol carrier protein concentrations that could produce discrepancies between total and bioavailable estradiol levels. We hypothesized that bioavailable estradiol levels are low in septic patients and sepsis nonsurvivors. Methods We conducted a combined case-control and prospective cohort study. Venous blood samples were obtained from 131 critically ill septic patients in the medical and surgical intensive care units at the University of Rochester Medical Center and 51 control subjects without acute illness. Serum bioavailable estradiol concentrations were calculated using measurements of total estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin. Comparisons were made between patients with severe sepsis and control subjects and between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was also performed.

We hypothesized that bioavailable estradiol levels are low in septic patients and sepsis nonsurvivors. Methods We conducted a combined case-control and prospective cohort study. Venous blood samples were obtained from 131 critically ill septic patients in the medical and surgical intensive care units at the University of Rochester Medical Center and 51 control subjects without acute illness. Serum bioavailable estradiol concentrations were calculated using measurements of total estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin. Comparisons were made between patients with severe sepsis and control subjects and between hospital survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was also performed. Results Bioavailable estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in sepsis patients than in control subjects (211 [78–675] pM vs. 100 [78–142] pM, p "",

All experiments were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources of the University of Rochester Medical Center (Protocol No. 2011-023), and an effort was made to minimize the number of animals used. We used 8- to 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice acquired from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). In all experiments, animals were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Depth of anesthesia was determined by the pedal reflex test. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5C with a rectal probe-controlled heated platform, and ECG and respiratory rate were monitored using a small animal physiological monitoring system (Harvard Apparatus). Anesthetized mice were fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and two cannulae were implanted into the right lateral ventricle (0.85 mm lateral, 2.10 mm ventral and 0.22 mm caudal to bregma) and the cisterna magna, as previously described (2). Using a computer-controlled syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite), we injected V = 5 μL of artificial CSF (126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.4 when gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) at 1 μL/s into the right lateral ventricle. We monitored ICP via the cisterna magna cannulation connected to a transducer attached to a pressure monitor (BP-1, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL). We have verified that the results do not change appreciably if we instead inject into the cisterna magna and measure ICP in the ventricle. We calculated the compliance C from the pressure-volume index (PVI): C = 0.4343·PVI/P0. The PVI is defined as the volume of fluid required to cause a tenfold pressure increase during bolus injection: PVI=V/(log10⁡[P_max/P_0]) The resistance R can be estimated as: R=(t·P_0)/(PVI·log10[P(t)·(P_max-P_0 )/(P_max·(P(t)-P_0))]) where P(t) is the pressure measured at time t. We expect R to be nearly constant, but to increase accuracy, we estimate R for each animal by averaging the results of the above equation to five evenly-spaced times during the experiment. 1.
